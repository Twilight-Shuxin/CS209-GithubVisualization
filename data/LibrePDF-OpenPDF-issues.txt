Existing line breaking methods follow standards and conventions for body text but do not work well for short Japanese text, such as in titles and headings. This new feature is optimized for these use cases.<\/p>\n<p>ICU 71 adds support for Hindi written in Latin letters (<code>hi_Latn<\/code>). The CLDR data for this increasingly popular locale has been significantly revised and expanded. Note that based on user expectations, hi_Latn incorporates a large amount of English, and can also be referred to as \u201cHinglish\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>ICU 71 and CLDR 41 are minor releases, mostly focused on bug fixes and small enhancements.

Another approach would be to use the run direction propery of the field but I couldn't find any docs on how to find it using  OpenPDF/iText (even later versions)\r\n\r\nRelated Issue: #\r\n\r\n## Unit-Tests for the new Feature/Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Unit-Tests added to reproduce the bug\r\n- [ ] Unit-Tests added to the added feature\r\n\r\n## Compatibilities Issues\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Testing details\r\nTry inserting these texts onto a field:\r\n\r\n```\r\nאחת שתיים שלוש four five\r\nOne two שלוש ארבע חמש\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both case their should be RTL because the Hebrew is more abundant.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n1.

BaseFont subset prefix generation deterministic","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nWhile trying to embed a font subset to a PDF, we have faced with an issue in OpenPdf, as it generates a new random name for a font subset each time a single PDF document is generated.\r\n\r\nAs in our signature creation tool, we need to execute the PDF generation twice, one for a ToBeSigned data generation and the second one for a final signed document generation, the generated PDF document shall be produced in a deterministic way.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes from a method [BaseFont.createSubsetPrefix()](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/1.3.26/openpdf/src/main/java/com/lowagie/text/pdf/BaseFont.java#L1356) generating a random prefix name for a font when a subset option is used. This makes the use of subsets impossible in our implementation, as the generated PDF and its digest respectively are always different.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make the prefix computation deterministic somehow?

in parsing of cross reference streams with multiple revisions","body":"**Description**\r\n\r\nWhen reading a cross reference stream, iText/OpenPdf clears the corresponding object from the internal cross reference information as that object ID can be re-used in later revisions and should not be accessed directly by normal user code anyways.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if in a multi-revision PDF that object ID indeed has been re-used in a later revision and OpenPdf reads that multi-revision document, the attempt to clear the entry for the cross reference stream actually clears the entry for the object the ID has been re-used for. As a consequence, OpenPdf cannot access that newer object.\r\n\r\nIn iText 5 this issue has been resolved in version 5.3.4.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSee [DSS-2570](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/tracker/browse/DSS-2570).\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nEither OpenPdf should not clear that entry at all (which would allow user code to easily access cross reference information) or it should clear it only if the object ID has not been re-used. \r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nCode in OpenPdf:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthisStream *= 2;\r\nif (thisStream < xref.length)\r\n    xref[thisStream] = -1;\r\n```\r\n_(com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfReader.readXRefStream(int))_\r\n\r\nCode in iText since 5.3.4:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthisStream *= 2;\r\nif (thisStream + 1 < xref.length && xref[thisStream] == 0 && xref[thisStream + 1] == 0)\r\n    xref[thisStream] = -1;\r\n```\r\n*(com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfReader.readXRefStream(long))*","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":602,"updated_at":"2022-05-31T20:03:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":1000330269,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":0,"closed_at":"2022-05-31T20:03:36Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/602/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"mkl-public","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11230215?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/mkl-public","site_admin":false,"id":11230215,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjMwMjE1","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkl-public/orgs"},"node_id":"I_kwDOA8KLhc47n9Qd"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-09-14T06:02:57Z","title":"Bump pitest-junit5-plugin from 0.14 to 0.15","body":"Bumps [pitest-junit5-plugin](https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin) from 0.14 to 0.15.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits<\/summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin/commit/918c8b8f8cf9459d25664a6b6748edf214260c2b\"><code>918c8b8<\/code><\/a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin/issues/62\">#62<\/a> from pitest/bump-junit-version<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin/commit/efc1962bdecdef722225e9a29843ea88a6930a18\"><code>efc1962<\/code><\/a> Build against JUnit platform 1.8.0<\/li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/pitest/pitest-junit5-plugin/compare/0.14...0.15\">compare view<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.pitest:pitest-junit5-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=0.14&new-version=0.15)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Note: since the `DefaultFontMapper` from OpenPDF is used it will always fallback to Helvetica anyways (`logicalName` is Deja Vu...): https://github.com/mppperez/OpenPDF/blob/f773081d4f169c6d84579a855ebbed1e93cfd8e9/openpdf/src/main/java/com/lowagie/text/pdf/DefaultFontMapper.java#L123-L193\r\n\r\nSo this won't have direct affect in the test but if a custom mapper is used that is not restricting to only those 3 fonts you may encounter a problem. _It is not expected that the PdfGraphics2D is changing the specified font on it's own although it was correctly used_. It looks like a project specific issue was built into OpenPDF (see below).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nExecute above mentioned test on a machine without Helvetica installed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUse the provided font (backwards compatibility is missing) in OpenPDF.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screenshot_562](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44845832/129175724-6ca3daee-d024-46f5-a4df-466b1c780d75.png)\r\n\r\n**System (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n - Used Font: Helvetica\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nUnfortunately I cannot reconstruct why this fix (see commit above) for Windows was built... or initially Windows and then changed to Mac (see commit history).  It looks like a project specific issue that was implemented in OpenPDF rather than in the appropriate project. At least making the FontDrawer a configurable property seems to be the more proper solution or just using the library with correct fonts instead of logical ones that may not be found.\r\n\r\nFurthermore `PdfGraphics2D.CompositeFontDrawer#splitStringIntoDisplayableParts` will even use different fonts just because they are in the same family as the specified one. If the user of the library wants to write text to a pdf and specifies a font that is not containing (some) characters specified in the text then this should be handled on the users side (may throw an exception? logging and skip? ...) but not in OpenPDF itself?

#408: Add a lock for protecting fontFamilies from race condition","body":"## Description of the new Feature/Bugfix\r\n\r\n**DO NOT MERGE until there exists a unit test that can validate this patch.**\r\n\r\nThis bug originates from iText 2, and it is caused by the race condition since it is possible to read from the list stored in the hashmap `fontFamilies` by the function `getFont()` and write to the same list by the function `registerFamily()` concurrently. Thus, the idea of this patch is to disallow accessing that hashmap simultaneously. This implementation utilizes `ReentrantReadWriteLock`, which will gain performance improvement under certain scenarios compared to other synchronization approaches.\r\n\r\nRelated Issue: #408, opensagres/xdocreport#59\r\n\r\n## Unit-Tests for the new Feature/Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Unit-Tests added to reproduce the bug\r\n\r\nSo far, I didn't figure out a way to reproduce that bug because this issue is caused by concurrency.

I realize it by inversing the method charToByte.\r\n\r\nRelated Issue: #\r\n\r\n## Unit-Tests for the new Feature/Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Unit-Tests added to reproduce the bug\r\n- [x] Unit-Tests added to the

using PdfCopyFields (broken since v1.1.0)","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nHere is a sample document with a table of contents on the first page: [openpdf_bug_test.pdf](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/files/6100746/openpdf_bug_test.pdf)\r\n\r\nI want to copy only the first page into a new file using code like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\n            InputStream stream = Main.class.getResourceAsStream(\"openpdf_bug_test.pdf\");\r\n\r\n            PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(stream);\r\n\r\n            byte[] bytes;\r\n\r\n            try

exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter$PdfBody.add(PdfWriter.java:394)\r\n\tat com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter$PdfBody.add(PdfWriter.java:390)\r\n\tat com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter.addToBody(PdfWriter.java:829)\r\n\tat

com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfCopyFields.close(PdfCopyFields.java:162)\r\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:30)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince OpenPDF v1.1.0 it only works if I specify \"1-2\" as a range because otherwise a NullPointerException occurs due to the missing page refs in the table of contents.\r\n\r\nUp to v1.0.5 it was possible to just copy range \"1\" and the missing page refs will be ignored.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFull reproducer project:\r\n[OpenPdfBugReproducer.zip](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/files/6100688/OpenPdfBugReproducer.zip)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIf a page has a reference to another page that's not part of the exported range this reference should just be ignored or stripped out. This seems to be what happens in version 1.0.5 and the old iText library.\r\n\r\nMaybe you won't want to allow this per default, but then there should be a way better exception than a NullPointerException. But I would still need an option to force that copy even if page references get lost.\r\n\r\n**System (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Used Font: Not

We are replacing iText:2.1.5 with OpenPDF in an application, and I found a [very old] unit test (with a PDF document which, at least for now, I can't share) that fails with the following stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfStamperImp.flatFields(PdfStamperImp.java:880)\r\n\tat com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfStamperImp.close(PdfStamperImp.java:162)\r\n\tat com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfStamper.close(PdfStamper.java:246)\r\n\tat [ommited-package-name].PdfTest.getStampedPdf(PdfTest.java:60)\r\n\tat [ommited-package-name].PdfTest.shouldLoadAndFlatAPdfStamped(PdfTest.java:51)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe unit test had a comment on it saying that [_once upon a time..._] iText was bumped from 2.1.5 to 2.1.7 but this issue arised, so they reverted it [and kept until today...] to 2.1.5. I was able to find out that [this block of code](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/blob/master/openpdf/src/main/java/com/lowagie/text/pdf/AcroFields.java#L239) didn't exist in 2.1.5 but was there in 2.1.7. After debugging said unit test, I came up with this fix.\r\n\r\nThe commit message has more details. Basically, it doesn't assume a PdfAppearance for a \"pageless annotation\" anymore.\r\n\r\nRelated Issue: #\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Unit-Tests for the new Feature/Bugfix\r\nNo unit tests were added or modified.\r\n\r\n## Compatibilities Issues\r\nNo compatibility issues. Existing unit tests execute correctly.\r\n\r\n## Testing details\r\nWe have a PDF document which would trigger the issue, but unfortunatelly we cannot share it.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/477/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":477,"updated_at":"2021-01-26T11:44:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/477/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":791391093,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/477/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/477.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/477","merged_at":"2021-01-26T11:44:34Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/477.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/477"},"state_reason":null,"comments":1,"closed_at":"2021-01-26T11:44:34Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/477","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/477/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/477","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":1,"+1":1,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/477/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"bsmelo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15204241?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/bsmelo","site_admin":false,"id":15204241,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjA0MjQx","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsmelo/orgs"},"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTU5NDU4MjM1"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-01-21T05:50:05Z","title":"Bump fop from 2.5 to 2.6","body":"Bumps fop from 2.5 to 2.6.\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.apache.xmlgraphics:fop&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.5&new-version=2.6)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

the text is missing when PDFReader opens a pdf file generated with OpenPDF, using the method getPageContent(). The file contains the expected contents when opening it in Acrobat Reader. The same happens when using PDFTextExtractor.getTextFromPage(). \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n(see attached testfile)\r\nThe text \"Ingen dosisdispenserings-data fundet\" is neither returned from the PDFReader.getPageContent(1) nor pdfTextExtractor.getTextFromPage(1).\r\n        \r\n```\r\n   PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(\"testGetEmptyDDCard.pdf\");\r\n   int pages = reader.getNumberOfPages();\r\n   PdfTextExtractor pdfTextExtractor = new PdfTextExtractor(reader);\r\n   StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();\r\n   for (int page = 1; page <= pages; page++) {\r\n      text.append(new String(pdfTextExtractor.getTextFromPage(page)));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n   assertTrue(text.toString().contains(\"Ingen dosisdispenserings-data fundet\"));   // This assertion fails\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would have expected, that all text are returned, including \"Ingen dosisdispenserings-data fundet\" from getTextFromPage so the assertion does no longer fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n**System (please complete the following information):**\r\n -

increase in PDF filesize since 1.3.12","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nAfter updating to the latest version we noticed that the pdfs we create using OpenPDF have massively increased in size.\r\n(e.g. a PDF with ~200 pages containing nested tables was 10MB and now is 150MB).\r\nI have traced it back to changes in 1.3.12. If I use a OpenPdf version < 1.3.12 our software outputs a 10MB file, If I update OpenPDF to anything >= 1.3.12 the very same code produces a 150MB file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCurrently I have no example, since we are running this in production. But it is solely dependent on changes in OpenPDF since reverting back to an old version results in smaller pdfs without changing any of the pdf generation code.\r\nMaybe someone has an idea where this behavior might stem from?\r\nPreparing an example is possible, but will take some time.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":450,"updated_at":"2020-11-22T11:09:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":736012432,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":25,"closed_at":"2020-11-22T11:09:52Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":2,"+1":2,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/450/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"renber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3481307?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/renber","site_admin":false,"id":3481307,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODEzMDc=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renber/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzYwMTI0MzI="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-11-02T07:21:29Z","title":"Bump bcprov-jdk15on from 1.66 to 1.67","body":"Bumps [bcprov-jdk15on](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java) from 1.66 to 1.67.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog<\/summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/blob/master/docs/releasenotes.html\">bcprov-jdk15on's changelog<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>...

signatures broken since 1.2.18","body":"This apparently harmless change in eb875bc24b688ced9b7ea57e021b1c48cec32ea9 broke (some) digital signatures due to rounding:\r\n```diff\r\n      bf.append('[');\r\n-     for (int i : range) bf.append(i).append(' ');\r\n+     for (long i : range) bf.append(i).append(' ');\r\n      bf.append(']');\r\n```\r\n\u2026because `ByteBuffer.append(int)` exists, while `ByteBuffer.append(long)` does not and thus implicitly uses `ByteBuffer.append(float)`, where the value doesn't fit exactly.\r\n\r\nFinal effect is a signature where this happens:\r\n```diff\r\n-/Filter/Adobe.PPKLite/Type/Sig/ByteRange [0 178 3704 225636843 ]\r\n+/Filter/Adobe.PPKLite/Type/Sig/ByteRange [0 178 3704 225636848 ]\r\n```\r\nNotice that the fourth number gets rounded up to the next multiple of 16, this breaks the range calculation by actually going after the end of file, but in other instances it is rounded down and we get a signature \"not covering the full document\" and also broken in any case, as during the signature the range used was right, so the hash is different.\r\n\r\nSmallest diff solution is using an explicit cast to double to avoid implicit cast to float:\r\n```diff\r\n      bf.append('[');\r\n-     for (long i : range) bf.append(i).append(' ');\r\n+     for (long i : range) bf.append((double) i).append(' ');\r\n      bf.append(']');\r\n```\r\n\u2026but I think that using `double`s to print `int`s and `long`s is really ugly, and probably re-writing both those methods to print an integral number directly is cleaner.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/383/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":383,"updated_at":"2020-06-24T11:20:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/383/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":643896812,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/383/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":6,"closed_at":"2020-06-23T16:03:00Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/383","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="},{"default":true,"color":"128A0C","name":"help

I've tried to restore previous behavior with the code changes of this pull request, or at least to mitigate the effects. This pull requests addresses the following two issues:\r\n\r\n1. With Apache FOP, if a glyph was not found in a font, there would be inserted the character '#'. This is different to previous behavior where nothing was changed, and it is especially annoying when one has got a string containing '\\n' or similar characters. Therefore, I've restored the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n2. Apache FOP supports ligatures. Because ligatures are not used in the same way in every language, Apache FOP asks for the language before substituting anything. The current default of OpenPDF is the language \"dflt\", which just means: Use ligatures wherever possible. I've not restored the previous default in this case (because using ligatures is fine), but made the language configurable per document, as some kind of work-around. I know that more would desireable here (e.g. specifying the language of each phrase), but I can't spend more time to this point at the moment (especially because I'm currently investigating more cases of changed behavior).\r\n\r\nI hope you are ok with these changes.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/352/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":352,"updated_at":"2020-04-22T07:52:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/352/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":599472485,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/352/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/352.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/352","merged_at":"2020-04-14T15:05:16Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/352.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/352"},"state_reason":null,"comments":3,"closed_at":"2020-04-14T15:05:16Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/352","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/352","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/352/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"armin-weber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53570385?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/armin-weber","site_admin":false,"id":53570385,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTcwMzg1","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/armin-weber/orgs"},"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDAzMTA3NzUw"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-04-03T13:28:51Z","title":"Missing embedded HTML Support with using openPDF with JBoss-Seam-PDF","body":"In my project we are using jboss-seam-pdf (https://github.com/albfernandez/jboss-seam) for report generation which is using IText2 as a PDF renderer.\r\n\r\nJBoss-Seam-PDF allows to embed HTML into the PDF document (<p:html>, see: https://docs.jboss.org/seam/2.3.1.Final/reference/html/itext.html).

This works, but another thing I need to do is replace a regular `fillColor` operation with a `fillColor` & `SpotColor` combination. \r\n\r\nCurrently I read the `byte[]` of each layers' PDF by using `getPageContent()` into a variable. I use the `PRTokenizer` to iterate through the tokens and when I come across the `\"rg\"` operation I inject the operations for color filling with a spotcolor.\r\n\r\nI have a `List<Byte>` in which I will store all existing bytes from `getPageContent()` while iterating it.\r\n\r\nThe Injection is currently done as follows:\r\n- construct a new `PdfContentByte` instance (using a PdfWriter that has the layers' PDF imported on its contentByte) \r\n- create the SpotColor with a specific name and RGB values copied from the `\"rg\"` operation\r\n- call the `setColorFill()` on the new PdfContentByte instance.\r\n- convert the PdfContentByte to `byte[]` by using `toPdf()` (again using the PdfWriter mentioned).\r\n- iterate the `byte[]` and add every entry to the `List<Byte>`.\r\n\r\nWhen the injection is done the main iteration of the layer will continue and all other existing bytes will be added. \r\n\r\nWhen a layer is completely iterated I convert the `List<Byte>` back to `byte[]` and use that for calling `setPageContent()` to update the layer with the SpotColor operation injected.\r\n\r\nFinally I add the layer to the final PDF and when all layers are done I `close()` the document.\r\n\r\nThis all gives no compiler and/or runtime issues and exports a PDF with the layers. The PDF is even visible in MacOS preview.\r\n\r\nSadly, when opening the PDF in Acrobat it gives an error and no layers are displayed.\r\nI validated the PDF and it gives the following errors:\r\n- Missing ColorSpace (3 matches, 1 page)\r\n- Missing Extended Graphic State (3 matches, 1 page)\r\n\r\nThe 3 matches are because there are 3 layers in which I try to add the SpotColor.\r\nI'm not sure what to do about the missing references and/or why they aren't added/copied to the final PDF.

of List no longer render \"bulletpoint\"-characters properly","body":"After upgrading to version 1.3.11 I noticed that my lists using `ZapfDingbatsList` do not render as they did previously. The \"bulletpoint\"-characters no longer seem to function properly. Actually all subclasses of `List` are affected by this bug.\r\n\r\n_The following sample code is used to demonstrate the issue:_\r\n```\r\nList list = new ZapfDingbatsList(43, 21);\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item A\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item B\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item C\"));\r\ndocument.add(list);\r\n\r\nlist = new ZapfDingbatsNumberList(43, 21);\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item A\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item B\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item C\"));\r\ndocument.add(list);\r\n\r\nlist = new RomanList(true, 21);\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item A\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item B\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item C\"));\r\ndocument.add(list);\r\n\r\nlist = new GreekList(true, 21);\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item A\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item B\"));\r\nlist.add(new ListItem(\"Item C\"));\r\ndocument.add(list);\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Here are the different results:_\r\n<img width=\"236\" alt=\"render-2-versions\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53262016/71845134-ef526100-30c7-11ea-9510-e84a9cda18bd.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe issue was introduced when the signature of `List#add` was changed to accept an `Element` instead of an `Object` without refactoring the subclasses as well. The `add`-method in `RomanList`, `GreekList`, `ZapfDingbatsList` and `ZapfDingbatsNumberList` are therefore not called (implicitly) since the `add`-method in `List` (baseclass) has a more specific signature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a workaround until the bug is fixed and a new version is released, the following code which explicitly calls the correct method by casting and using the actual subclass can be used:\r\n```\r\nZapfDingbatsList remarks = new ZapfDingbatsList(43, 21);\r\nremarks.add((Object) new ListItem(\"Item A\"));\r\nremarks.add((Object) new ListItem(\"Item B\"));\r\nremarks.add((Object) new ListItem(\"Item C\"));\r\n```","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":322,"updated_at":"2020-01-19T12:08:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":545914168,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":2,"closed_at":"2020-01-16T07:37:54Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":3,"+1":1,"rocket":1,"hooray":1,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/322/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"mluppi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53262016?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/mluppi","site_admin":false,"id":53262016,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjYyMDE2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mluppi/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDU5MTQxNjg="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-01-06T11:21:40Z","title":"Issue-320:

Remove it entirely. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not see any benefit in having this item.\r\n1. Introduce mechanism or some parameters that would allow to control it.\r\n1.

e.g.\r\n```\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Element-1\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Element-1-1<\/li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Element-1-2<\/li>\r\n\t\t<\/ol>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Element-2\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Element-2-1<\/li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Element-2-2<\/li>\r\n\t\t<\/ol>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n```\r\nAs a result, only the first-level elements are returned: ['Element-1', 'Element-2'].\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the HTMLWorker.endElement() method:\r\n```\r\n542: \tif (tag.equals(HtmlTags.UNORDEREDLIST)\r\n543:\t\t|| tag.equals(HtmlTags.ORDEREDLIST)) {\r\n...\r\n558:\t((TextElementArray) stack.peek()).add((Element) obj);\r\n```\r\nFor nested lists, variable 'obj' is of type 'com.lowagie.text.List', but it is casted to type 'Element'. Therefore the method 'add(Element o)' is called, but this method does not handle lists. \r\nThe proper method is 'add(List nested)' in class 'com.lowagie.text.List'. So the above code should look like this:\r\n```\r\n558:\t{\r\n559:\t\tObject peek = stack.peek();\r\n560:\t\tif (peek instanceof com.lowagie.text.List && obj instanceof com.lowagie.text.List) {\r\n561:\t\t\t((com.lowagie.text.List) peek).add((com.lowagie.text.List) obj);\r\n562:\t\t}\r\n563:\t\telse \r\n564:\t\t{\r\n565:\t\t\t((TextElementArray) peek).add((Element) obj);\r\n566:\t\t}                  \r\n567:\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\nPlease fix this bug so we can use the official version again.

not visible in Paragraph if keepTogether is set to true","body":"First and foremost I would like apologize if this is not a place for this question. Essentially I'm repeating the question I asked a while ago on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57787275/why-is-pdfptable-not-visible-in-paragraph-if-keeptogether-is-set-to-true).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to group table with two texts (one above, and one below table) to prevent splitting of elements when they don't fit in remaining empty space on page.\r\n\r\nElements are added to Paragraph with _keepTogether_ set to true. I noticed peculiar behavior when using _setKeepTogether(true)_.\r\n\r\n[If _setKeepTogether(true)_ is called, table won't appear, other elements will.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/43Q48.png)\r\n[If _setKeepTogether(false)_ - everything works as expected.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehYBE.png)\r\n\r\nHere is my code example:\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws DocumentException, FileNotFoundException {\r\n  Document document = new Document();\r\n  PdfWriter pdfWriter = PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream(DEST));\r\n  document.open();\r\n\r\n  PdfPTable table = new PdfPTable(2);\r\n  table.addCell(\"Lorem\");\r\n  table.addCell(\"ipsum\");\r\n  table.addCell(\"dolor\");\r\n  table.addCell(\"sit\");\r\n\r\n  Paragraph mainParagraph = new Paragraph();\r\n  Paragraph paragraph1 = new Paragraph(\"Text above table\");\r\n  Paragraph paragraph2 = new Paragraph(\"Text below table\");\r\n\r\n  mainParagraph.add(paragraph1);\r\n  mainParagraph.add(table);\r\n  mainParagraph.add(paragraph2);\r\n\r\n  // if keeptogether is true, table is not visible\r\n  mainParagraph.setKeepTogether(true);\r\n\r\n  document.add(mainParagraph);\r\n\r\n  document.close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny clue as to what is happening?\r\n\r\nCode is tested with latest (1.3.11) OpenPdf version and openjdk 1.8.0_192.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth I also tested with itext 2.1.7 and 5.5.13. Version 2.1.7 has the same problem and in 5.5.13 table is visible with _keepTogether_ set to true. \r\n\r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":271,"updated_at":"2019-10-06T19:48:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":498287041,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":1,"closed_at":"2019-10-06T19:48:30Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/271/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"matija137","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55794910?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/matija137","site_admin":false,"id":55794910,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzk0OTEw","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matija137/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0OTgyODcwNDE="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2019-09-23T20:51:55Z","title":"Fixes PageNumbersWatermark example","body":"Fixes #242 #196\r\n\r\nThe \"restoreState\" should be called outside the if","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/270/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":270,"updated_at":"2019-09-24T17:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/270/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":497322110,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/270/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/270.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/270","merged_at":"2019-09-24T17:59:37Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/270.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/270"},"state_reason":null,"comments":2,"closed_at":"2019-09-24T17:59:37Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/270","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/270/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/270","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/270/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"albfernandez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701620?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/albfernandez","site_admin":false,"id":2701620,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE2MjA=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albfernandez/orgs"},"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzIwNDc2MDY5"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2019-09-22T11:30:19Z","title":"Using this library for a commercial use?","body":"Hi, my name's Marco and I write my first app. I'd like to use this library for create a PDF report.

bug concerning stroke colors when simulating bold fonts.","body":"I've encountered a bug in PdfGraphics2D#drawString() when simulating a bold font. It is quite hard to find an easily reproducible example, but I hope static code analysis is clear enough in this case.\r\n\r\nUntil now, when simulating a bold font, the stroke color is changed by using PdfContentByte#setColorStroke(). Unfortunately, this means that the value of paintStroke is not updated in PdfGraphics2D. This incorrect state of paintStroke only will have an effect if the next time the stroke color is used it is expected to have the same color as it had before cb.setColorStroke() was called. OpenPDF then assumes the desired color has already been set and doesn't change it again, leading to elements painted in an unexpected color.\r\n\r\nUsing setStrokePaint() instead fixes this bug

state.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/220/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":220,"updated_at":"2019-08-13T06:01:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/220/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":478299808,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/220/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/220.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/220","merged_at":"2019-08-08T09:34:50Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/220.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/220"},"state_reason":null,"comments":4,"closed_at":"2019-08-08T09:34:50Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/220","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="},{"default":true,"color":"128A0C","name":"help

(See [this example](https://dzone.com/articles/10-effective-tips-on-using-maven) recommending to explicitly repeat transitive dependencies in their pom, forgetting in my opinion that it will defeat your library updating its dependencies when it's needed.)\r\n\r\nFor that, I have located three commits adding dependencies which I think don't have a good enough reason to be added in openpdf:\r\n- https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/commit/7b2a602fd627eeba69b7aa030551d8ed4cd672d7#comments\r\n- https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/commit/8ad6e9bf012d67eb4149bb8064cf8df8f13d3a63#comments\r\n- https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/commit/fb4ec297b0e6a555ece9166183f905068c89bf2f#comments\r\n\r\nFor juniversalchardet and commons-compress dependencies, it is a bit less obvious if they have, or

The imports are sanselan instead of commons.imaging. Basically just need to swap out imports. No other changes are necessary. I am using sed locally to make this change on the fly for [my gentoo ebuilds](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/blob/master/dev-java/openpdf/openpdf-9999.ebuild#L44).\r\n\r\nThis repo [commons-imaging](https://github.com/apache/commons-imaging)\r\n\r\nNot this [old sanselan](https://github.com/apache/sanselan) repo\r\n\r\nI believe the problem lies in maven central not having anything for [commons-imaging](https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cga%7C4%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.commons%22).  It only has a one for the [old sanselan](https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Csanselan). This is the only [commons-imaging](https://search.maven.org/classic/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22commons-imaging%22) on maven central and is not apache commons imaging.

Remove SimpleXMLParser.escapeXML. \r\n- Deprecate SimpleXMLParser. Should use a XML parser from a library instead from now on.\r\n- Removed ExceptionConverter. Added simpler ExceptionUtil class.\r\n- Add dependency to Apache Commons IO and Apache Commons Compress. Remove the LZWDecoder class.\r\n- Add dependency on Sanselan (Apache Commons Imaging) and use that to load images. Remove old custom BMP, GIF, PNG, TIF and JBIG image codecs.\r\n- Removed the pdf-rtf module.\r\n- Remove the class BidiOrder. Remove support for bidirectional text support.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this the contents of misc_licenses.txt is reduced considerably, making OpenPDF significantly more LGPL/MPL consistent. The only remaining class mentioned there now is SimpleXMLParser. That class is very-non-trivial to replace, and it is still in use in iText, so it should be safe.\r\n\r\nI intend to merge this pull-request in some days if there are no strong objections.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/90/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":90,"updated_at":"2018-10-29T22:25:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/90/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":347616934,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/90/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/90.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/90","merged_at":"2018-08-06T08:15:18Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/90.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/90"},"state_reason":null,"comments":9,"closed_at":"2018-08-06T08:15:18Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/90","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/90/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/90","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/90/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"andreasrosdal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41650711?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/andreasrosdal","site_admin":false,"id":41650711,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjUwNzEx","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/orgs"},"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjA2MTkxMjk3"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2018-08-02T20:57:43Z","title":"misc_licenses.txt","body":" ","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":89,"updated_at":"2018-10-01T01:00:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89/comments","active_lock_reason":"resolved","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":347171881,"state":"closed","locked":true,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":0,"closed_at":"2018-08-06T08:15:30Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/89/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"andreasrosdal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41650711?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/andreasrosdal","site_admin":false,"id":41650711,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjUwNzEx","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreasrosdal/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDcxNzE4ODE="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2018-08-02T10:29:04Z","title":"SHA-1 is unsafe / deprecated","body":"SHA-1 is unsafe / deprecated.

I don't want to integrate old code because of maintainability...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nM.T.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I know, this change has been made by another repository, but the original repository has not been updated since at least 3 years...","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":75,"updated_at":"2018-07-31T18:38:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":310911494,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":4,"closed_at":"2018-07-31T18:38:12Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/75/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"mtwords","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1053749?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/mtwords","site_admin":false,"id":1053749,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTM3NDk=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtwords/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTA5MTE0OTQ="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2018-04-03T09:05:52Z","title":"Add a deprecated method ot keep binary compatibility with itext-4.2.0","body":"Closes #72.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/74/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":74,"updated_at":"2018-04-15T12:20:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/74/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":310752167,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/74/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/74.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/74","merged_at":"2018-04-15T12:20:20Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/74.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/74"},"state_reason":null,"comments":0,"closed_at":"2018-04-15T12:20:20Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/74","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/74/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/74","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/74/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"lapo-luchini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/420454?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/lapo-luchini","site_admin":false,"id":420454,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDQ1NA==","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lapo-luchini/orgs"},"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc5MDM0OTA1"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2018-04-02T23:06:25Z","title":"Image.getInstance: mono PNG with color ICC profile displays wrong","body":"Although it doesn't make a lot of sense to me, a monochrome PNG (1 component) might have a color ICC profile (3 components).

The latter was at `4.1.6` [at that point](https://github.com/itext/itextsharp/commit/1d0520c6c2e6792fa0599f1386047454093036b6). However, iText Software never released a build based on the `4.2.0` tag. It was a mid-development construct and the software wasn't guaranteed to be stable at that point. When iText migrated from SVN to Git, some technical constructs were cleaned up (by me personally, see full disclosure below), including the internal `4.2.0` tag. As far as iText Software concerns, there never was a release of \"iText 4\".\r\n  * [2.1.7-59-g935969371a](https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/commit/935969371a) (27 November 2009) was the last pre-AGPL commit and corresponds with the former `4.2.0` tag in SVN.\r\n  * [2.1.7-60-gf69dd81b2e](https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/commit/f69dd81b2e) (1 December 2009) is where the AGPL headers were added\r\n* [iText 5.0.0](https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/releases/tag/5.0.0) (8 December  2009) was the first AGPL release by iText Software.\r\n* On 31 August 2010, GitHub user [ymasory](https://github.com/ymasory) uploaded a version of iText \"MPL/LGPL\" to Github. It is unclear if this was based on `2.1.7` or on `2.1.7-59-g935969371a`. They did not accept pull requests or did any other development.\r\n* On 19 September 2012, a now-defunct New York software startup called [InProTopia Corporation](https://github.com/weiyeh/iText-4.2.0/blob/master/pom.xml#L24) (as far as I can tell, founded by a student of the Columbia University) took ymasory's repo and used that to upload a Maven build of \"iText 4.2.0\" and \"iText 4.2.1\" to Maven Central. However, they used (or hijacked?) `com.lowagie` as `GroupId`, which they were not allowed to do according to [Apache's Guide to uploading artifacts to the Central Repository](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html). This is explained in a blog post on iText's website: http://itextpdf.com/maven-update-problem-with-itext-4.2.2. See also this Stack Overflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14213851/766786\r\n* For clarity of this overview, I skipped some of the intermediate forks.\r\n\r\nConclusion: this project should do it's due diligence and make absolutely sure what it is based upon: is it iText **2.1.7** or is it iText **2.1.7-59-g935969371a**? I don't want to sound like I'm spreading FUD, but you need to make absolutely sure that your users aren't in uncharted territory.\r\n\r\nAs a side note (maybe this should be a separate issue?), if you ever plan to upload to Maven Central, then you need to change every reference to `com.lowagie` to something else, as described in the link above.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you contact [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) for legal and technical advice. They have extensive experience with community developers taking over an Open Source project after a license change. \r\n\r\n**Full disclosure**: I am QA & Release Engineer at iText Software, but I've been an Open Source user & advocate since decades before I joined iText Software. From a personal point of view, I wish this project good luck because it is 8 years behind in development. The fact that I took considerable time to do my research for this issue, should give you a clue that I don't want to intentionally harm this project. From a professional point of view, I welcome the competition. It keeps us on edge. :-)","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":18,"updated_at":"2017-02-15T10:44:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":207753844,"state":"closed","locked":true,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":1,"closed_at":"2017-02-15T09:50:41Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/18/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"amedee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463961?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/amedee","site_admin":false,"id":463961,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mzk2MQ==","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amedee/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDc3NTM4NDQ="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2017-02-02T18:10:37Z","title":"PdfGraphics2D.java: Add missing public keyword on constructor","body":"When calling the main PdfGraphics2D constructor, an error was given\r\nsaying that it was private.

Fix Temporary File Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n","body":"\n# Security Vulnerability Fix\n\nThis pull request fixes a Temporary File Information Disclosure Vulnerability, which existed in this project.\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe system temporary directory is shared between all users on most unix-like systems (not MacOS, or Windows). Thus, code interacting with the system temporary directory must be careful about file interactions in this directory, and must ensure that the correct file posix permissions are set.\n\nThis PR was generated because a call to `File.createTempFile(..)` was detected in this repository in a way that makes this project vulnerable to local information disclosure.\nWith the default uname configuration, `File.createTempFile(..)` creates a file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file.\n\n### Impact\n\nInformation in this file is visible to other local users, allowing a malicious actor co-resident on the same machine to view potentially sensitive files.\n\n#### Other Examples\n\n - [CVE-2020-15250](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp) - junit-team/junit\n - [CVE-2021-21364](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hpv8-9rq5-hq7w) - swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2) - netty/netty\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q) - netty/netty\n\n# The Fix\n\nThe fix has been to convert the logic above to use the following API that was introduced in Java 1.7.\n\n```java\nFile tmpDir = Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\").toFile();\n```\n\nThe API both creates the file securely, ie. with a random, non-conflicting name, with file permissions that only allow the currently executing user to read or write the contents of this file.\nBy default, `Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\")` will create a file with the permissions `-rw-------`, which only allows the user that created the file to view/write the file contents.\n\n# :arrow_right: Vulnerability Disclosure :arrow_left:\n\n:wave: Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!\n\nFirst question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!\n\n 1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!\n 2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To\n\nYou have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:\n\n 1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.\n 2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the [Snyk's Disclosure Email](mailto:report@snyk.io).\n\n## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\n\nThis vulnerability was automatically detected by GitHub's CodeQL using this [CodeQL Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure/).\n\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).\n\nI'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.\n\n## Source\n\nThis contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly hand crafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\n\nThe source code that generated this PR can be found here:\n[SecureTempFileCreation](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/SecureTempFileCreation.java)\n\n## Opting-Out\n\nIf you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:\n\n```\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research\nDisallow: *\n```\n\nThis bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.\n\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.\n\n## CLA Requirements\n\n_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._\n\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin\n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Sponsorship & Support\n\nThis contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.\n\nThis PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.\n\n## Tracking\n\nAll PR's generated as part of this fix are tracked here: https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/issues/18\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/852/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":852,"updated_at":"2022-11-19T02:13:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/852/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":1456121734,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/852/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/852.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/852","merged_at":null,"diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/852.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/852"},"state_reason":null,"comments":1,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/852","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/852/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/852","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/852/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"JLLeitschuh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1323708?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/JLLeitschuh","site_admin":false,"id":1323708,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjM3MDg=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLLeitschuh/orgs"},"node_id":"PR_kwDOA8KLhc5DQzqJ"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2022-11-15T06:00:49Z","title":"Bump mockito-core from 4.8.0 to 4.9.0","body":"Bumps [mockito-core](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) from 4.8.0 to 4.9.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes<\/summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases\">mockito-core's releases<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.9.0<\/h2>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Changelog generated by <a href=\"https://github.com/shipkit/shipkit-changelog\">Shipkit Changelog Gradle Plugin<\/a><\/em><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><\/p>\n<h4>4.9.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2022-11-14 - <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/compare/v4.8.1...v4.9.0\">6 commit(s)<\/a> by Andrei Solntsev, Rafael Winterhalter, Rick Ossendrijver, dependabot[bot]<\/li>\n<li>Upgrade objenesis 3.2 -&gt; 3.3 [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2784\">#2784<\/a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2784\">mockito/mockito#2784<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Upgrade objenesis 3.2 -&gt; 3.3 [(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2783\">#2783<\/a>)](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2783\">mockito/mockito#2783<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Avoids clearing stale weak entries from critical code segments.

However, this is problematic when you do not know in advance what PDF format you deal with. Therefore in the default configuration, an update of a PDF/A document with a font subset breaks its PDF/A compliance.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I added an additional condition to trigger the CIDSet creation, when a Font Subset is used:\r\n```\r\nif (subset || writer.getPDFXConformance() == PdfWriter.PDFA1A || writer.getPDFXConformance() == PdfWriter.PDFA1B) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change should allow keeping the old behavior for defined PDFXConformance, but also will not break PDF/A compatibility for documents when a format is not known in advance (for example when signing a bulk of PDF documents).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, PDFBox and iText7 seem to created CIDSet in all cases.\r\n\r\n## Unit-Tests for the new Feature/Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Unit-Tests added to reproduce the bug\r\n- [X] Unit-Tests added to the added feature\r\n\r\n## Compatibilities Issues\r\nCIDSet will be create when a font subset is used.\r\n\r\n## Testing details\r\nAdded unit tests to check text creation options with subset enabled/disabled.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/815/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":815,"updated_at":"2022-09-15T07:39:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/815/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":1374073196,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/815/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/815.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/815","merged_at":null,"diff_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/815.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pulls/815"},"state_reason":null,"comments":1,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/815","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/815/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/pull/815","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":3,"+1":2,"rocket":0,"hooray":1,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/815/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"bsanchezb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23361149?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/bsanchezb","site_admin":false,"id":23361149,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzYxMTQ5","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/orgs"},"node_id":"PR_kwDOA8KLhc4_AHyl"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2022-09-15T07:25:54Z","title":"Add optional metadata/info update in a sequential revision","body":"## Description of the new Feature/Bugfix\r\nWhen changing a document using sequential update (_append=true_), a new /Metadata and /Info dictionaries are being included to the new revision overriding the original values.

I only show the \"vertical\" borders of cell in order to display only columns.

I was told from the developers that the following is an OpenPdf issue.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the signature on a pdf file better looking a good way is to use  the TeX system. A wrote a trivial script that can create the visual part of the signature using XeLaTeX (so any font can be used, any color, and so many other things can be tweaked like lineskip). This is done every time so that TeX gets the proper timestamp to the image it creates.\r\nThe pdf output of xetex can be converted to png and included as background to the visual signature with empty text. Finally the script calls the JSignPdf on the command line to complete the task.\r\n\r\nThis produces really beautiful signatures but there is a problem with the image format. png is not scalable and JSignPdf does not know how to use svg instead of png.\r\n\r\nSVG can be embedded in pdf (xetex does it for example). So my question is\r\nif it would be easy to support a scalable format such as svg. Or even pdf which might be simpler (I do not know).

documents with shared objects/streams gets the modified page blank after signing","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nFor certain documents putting a visible signature in a page which has a /Contents with an array where one or more of the objects within it has the same number as an object in an other page causes the page with the visible signature to be blank. (Additionally if signed more then once, all but the last signature will show up as invalid in Acrobat.)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the issue\r\n1. Sample Code\r\n```\r\ntry (PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(\"pdflib-duplicated-out.pdf\");\r\n        FileInputStream ksIn = new FileInputStream(\"dss10_keystore.p12\")) {\r\n\r\n    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());\r\n    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(\"pkcs12\", \"BC\");\r\n    ks.load(ksIn, \"foo123\".toCharArray());\r\n    PrivateKey key = (PrivateKey) ks.getKey(\"signer00003\", null);\r\n    Certificate[] chain = ks.getCertificateChain(\"signer00003\");\r\n\r\n    FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(new File(\"target\", \"pdflib-duplicated-out-signed1.pdf\"));\r\n    PdfStamper stp = PdfStamper.createSignature(reader, fout, '\\0', new File(\"/tmp\"), true);\r\n    PdfSignatureAppearance sap = stp.getSignatureAppearance();\r\n    sap.setCrypto(key, chain, null, PdfSignatureAppearance.WINCER_SIGNED);\r\n\r\n    // Make a modification so the page will be rewritten as it does not happen for this file otherwise for unclear resons\r\n    stp.getUnderContent(2).rectangle(1, 1, 100, 100);\r\n\r\n    sap.setVisibleSignature(new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200), 2, null);\r\n    stp.close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull project is available here: https://github.com/netmackan/openpdf-eliminatestreams-issue\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAdding a digital signature to a PDF should not make the page with the visible signature blank. Also it should be possible to sign the same PDF multiple times without the verifier to complain about the previous revisions to have been modified.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThis screenshot shows the PDF after being signed. Normally all three pages should look similar but now page 2 is blank:\r\n![Three pages where the second is blank](https://github.com/netmackan/openpdf-eliminatestreams-issue/raw/main/pdflib-duplicated-out-signed1.png)\r\n\r\n**System (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux. Verifying on Windows.\r\n - Used Font: No special\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFrom debugging it can be seen that in the and of reading the PDF in the PdfReader class there is a method call _eliminateSharedStreams()_ that seems to be causing this. Removing that call and the PDF seems to look correct and any further digital signatures verifies correctly in Acrobat.\r\n\r\nPDF tools like iText RUPS shows a null entry in the array after signing and pdfcpu complains about \"nil\" objects. However, looking closer with the debugger shows that the shared references in the array are being replaced with new object numbers, however those objects are not added to the new PDF.\r\n\r\nFork with the eliminateSharedStreams() call commented out: https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/compare/master...netmackan:no-eliminate-shared-streams-2\r\n\r\nI have 4 different files with this issue created/modified using either QuarkExpress or pdf-lib.js. Unfortunately, those can not be shared however. I have managed to reproduce the issue with a public file which is available here (as part of the sample code):

The line causing the issue is copied below:\r\n```\r\nacroForm.drawSignatureAppearences(signature, llx, lly, urx, ury);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is, as the result, an empty signature field is being created with a pre-configured font settings, which are not necessary will be used after the signature creation. This may cause an incompliance to a PDF/A specification for a produced document.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```\r\n// get Stamper\r\n\r\nPdfStamper stp = ....\r\nstp.addSignature(...);\r\nstp.close();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe would like to know the reason why the Default Appearance is being added to an AcroForm for an empty signature field, not containing any visual data? As defined in ISO 32000-1, the fields _/DA_ and _/DR_ are optional for the AcroForm dictionary, therefore there is no strong requirement for its addition.\r\nMoreover, removing of the line does not seem to be causing any issues with existing unit tests available in OpenPDF project, nor in our testing.\r\nThus, we would appreciate any comments regarding this topic. If it is not necessary, to my opinion, it would be advisable to remove signature appearance drawing from _PdfStamper.addSignature(...)_ and _PdfAcroForm.addSignature(...)_ methods as a default behavior.\r\n\r\n**System (please complete the following information):**\r\nOpenPdf 1.3.26\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTo demonstrate the difference between two documents created with and without executing the #drawSignatureAppearences method, I attach two PDF documents to this ticket.\r\n\r\n[new-pdf-with-da.pdf](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/files/8186840/new-pdf-with-da.pdf) (with #drawSignatureAppearences)\r\n[new-pdf-without-da.pdf](https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/files/8186841/new-pdf-without-da.pdf) (without #drawSignatureAppearences)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAleksandr.\r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":680,"updated_at":"2022-03-10T13:21:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":1159756003,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":4,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/680/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"bsanchezb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23361149?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/bsanchezb","site_admin":false,"id":23361149,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzYxMTQ5","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsanchezb/orgs"},"node_id":"I_kwDOA8KLhc5FIHjj"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2022-03-03T06:29:31Z","title":"Exception when registering Unicode Font","body":"I got an exception registering an unicode.ttf font, \r\nFontFactory.register( LOCAL_FONT_FILE.getAbsolutePath(), \"Unicode\");\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea which could be the reason?

This is not correct according to the spec.\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\nThere seems to be problem with the current implementation when changing or adding fonts for form fields.\r\nOriginal PDF:\r\n```\r\n108 0 obj\r\n<<\/T(names)/Kids[213 0 R 63 0 R 146 0 R]/V() /DA(/Arial 8 Tf 0 g)/FT/Tx>>\r\nendobj\r\n213 0 obj\r\n<<\/P 57 0 R/Subtype/Widget/F 4/Type/Annot/MK<<\/BG[1.0 1.0 1.0]>>/Parent 108 0 R/Rect[48.6151 663.511 278.523 674.84]/AP<<\/N 21 0 R>>>>\r\nendobj\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now I change the font from Arial to TimesNewRoman \r\n```\r\nBaseFont font = BaseFont.createFont(BaseFont.TIMES_ROMAN, encoding, BaseFont.EMBEDDED);\r\nstamper.getAcroFields().setFieldProperty(\"names\", \"textfont\", font), null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the result is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n127 0 obj\r\n<<\/TU(AlternateFieldName)/T(names)/Kids[109 0 R 82 0 R 110 0 R]/V(Else Something)/DA(/Arial 8 Tf 0 g)/FT/Tx/Ff 29360130>>\r\nendobj\r\n109 0 obj\r\n<<\/BS<<\/S/I/W 1>>/P 64 0 R/Subtype/Widget/F 4/Type/Annot/DA(/TiRo 11 Tf 1 1 1 rg )/MK<<\/BC[1 0 0]/R 0/BG[0.10196 0.2 0.30196]>>/Parent 127 0 R/Rect[45 135 150 155]/AP<<\/N 17 0 R>>>>\r\nendobj\r\n```\r\nThe result is not correct I would say:\r\n1. The DA of the parent stays the same\r\n2. The DA is added to the child thus the widget \r\n\r\nBut according to the PDF spec it belongs to the formfield (thus `values` in openPDF words).\r\nAdding the DA to the widget is the problem.  When looking at the implementation the error seems to be (AcroFields.java lines 1071/1072)\r\n\r\n```\r\n public boolean setFieldProperty(String field, String name, Object value, int inst[]) {\r\n  ...\r\n  item.getWidget(k).put(PdfName.DA, s);\r\n  markUsed(item.getWidget(k));\r\n```\r\nWhen changing it to:\r\n```\r\n item.getValue(k).put(PdfName.DA, s);\r\n markUsed(item.getValue(k));\r\n```\r\nsolved it for me. Now the parent element contains the correct DA:\r\n\r\n```\r\n127 0 obj\r\n<<\/T(names)/Kids[109 0 R 82 0 R 110 0 R]/V(Else Something)/DA(/TiRo 11 Tf 1 1 1 rg )/FT/Tx/Ff 29360130>>\r\nendobj\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Summary:** When updating the font of a form field the DA key is added to the wrong dictionary. \r\n                      Any thoughts/views/rejections on this? If not I would create a merge request for this.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":555,"updated_at":"2021-06-03T12:45:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":909700071,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":0,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/555/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"Lonzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830174?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/Lonzak","site_admin":false,"id":1830174,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzAxNzQ=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MDk3MDAwNzE="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-05-24T02:17:41Z","title":"Font embedded setting may not work","body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nFont `embedded` config may not work.\r\nI tried: https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/wiki/Multi-byte-character-language-support-with-TTF-fonts with Jaldi-Regular.ttf in https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/tree/master/openpdf/src/test/resources/fonts/jaldi .\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the issue\r\n1.

The reporting tool we use is JasperReports which calls in to OpenPDF to find its fonts but it wasn't finding them no matter what. After a bit of digging through the sources, it seems like the list of available fonts has been hard coded using a completely unrelated framework to what the JVM is doing. I may be misunderstanding this greatly due to my limited knowledge in this area, but is there a reason OpenPDF doesn't use java.awt for the font lookup? The JVM already does all the leg work for loading in fonts via the OS and the corresponding fontconfig if they exist.\r\n\r\nI know this issue should be fairly easily addressed by providing a JAR for JasperReports to handle the font extensions, however we do have a large number of releases and servers that make this more of an issue.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis is a basic test to see what is available to our JVM runtime (These are groovy scripts I am testing with):\r\n```\r\nimport java.awt.*;\r\nfinal Font[] fonts = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getAllFonts();\r\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < fonts.length; i++) {\r\n  System.out.println(fonts[i].getFontName() + \" : \" + fonts[i].getFamily() + \" : \" + fonts[i].getName());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd some logic to test the matcher:\r\n```\r\nimport java.awt.*;\r\n\r\nmatchFont(\"Liberation Sans\", Font.PLAIN);\r\nmatchFont(\"Liberation Serif\", Font.PLAIN);\r\nmatchFont(\"Liberation Mono\", Font.PLAIN);\r\nmatchFont(\"DejaVu Sans\", Font.PLAIN);\r\nmatchFont(\"DejaVu Serif\", Font.PLAIN);\r\nmatchFont(\"DejaVu Sans Mono\", Font.PLAIN);\r\nmatchFont(\"Helvetica\", Font.PLAIN);\r\n\r\nvoid matchFont(String fontName, int fontType) {\r\n  Font font = new Font(fontName, fontType, 10);\r\n  System.out.println(\"testFontName=\" + fontName + \": matchFamily=\" + font.getFamily()+\", matchName=\" + font.getFontName());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\ntestFontName=Liberation Sans: matchFamily=Liberation Sans, matchName=Liberation Sans\r\ntestFontName=Liberation Serif: matchFamily=Liberation Serif, matchName=Liberation Serif\r\ntestFontName=Liberation Mono: matchFamily=Liberation Mono, matchName=Liberation Mono\r\ntestFontName=DejaVu Sans: matchFamily=DejaVu Sans, matchName=DejaVu Sans\r\ntestFontName=DejaVu Serif: matchFamily=Dialog, matchName=Dialog.plain\r\ntestFontName=DejaVu Sans Mono: matchFamily=Dialog, matchName=Dialog.plain\r\ntestFontName=Helvetica: matchFamily=SansSerif, matchName=SansSerif.plain\r\n```\r\n\r\nA couple of the fonts aren't available or configured so it just matches to a generic one.\r\n\r\nHere is my attempt as OpenPDF matching:\r\n```\r\nimport com.lowagie.text.*;\r\n\r\nmatchFont(\"Liberation Sans\");\r\nmatchFont(\"Liberation Serif\");\r\nmatchFont(\"Liberation Mono\");\r\nmatchFont(\"DejaVu Sans\");\r\nmatchFont(\"DejaVu Serif\");\r\nmatchFont(\"DejaVu Sans Mono\");\r\nmatchFont(\"Helvetica\");\r\nmatchFont(\"Courier\");\r\n\r\nvoid matchFont(String fontName) {\r\n  Font font = FontFactory.getFont(fontName, 10);\r\n  System.out.println(\"testFontName=\" + fontName + \", matchFamilyName=\" + font.getFamilyname() + \", baseFont=\" + (font.getBaseFont() ? font.getFamilyname() : null));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\ntestFontName=Liberation Sans, matchFamilyName=unknown, baseFont=null\r\ntestFontName=Liberation Serif, matchFamilyName=unknown, baseFont=null\r\ntestFontName=Liberation Mono, matchFamilyName=unknown, baseFont=null\r\ntestFontName=DejaVu Sans, matchFamilyName=unknown, baseFont=null\r\ntestFontName=DejaVu Serif, matchFamilyName=unknown, baseFont=null\r\ntestFontName=DejaVu Sans Mono, matchFamilyName=unknown, baseFont=null\r\ntestFontName=Helvetica, matchFamilyName=Helvetica, baseFont=Helvetica\r\ntestFontName=Courier, matchFamilyName=Courier, baseFont=Courier\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the FontFactoryImp, the list of fonts appears to be hard coded if you are not manually registering them as a developer.\r\n\r\nThis is likely not a bug and more of a design issue which would be more of a feature request, but I want to verify if I am missing anything as a part of this process of adding more fonts.\r\n\r\nAny assistance or input on this would be greatly appreciated.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":494,"updated_at":"2021-05-02T16:57:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":817778277,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":3,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="},{"default":true,"color":"128A0C","name":"help wanted","description":null,"id":406365147,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/help%20wanted","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDc="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":2,"+1":2,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/494/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"Sanadis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13457463?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/Sanadis","site_admin":false,"id":13457463,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDU3NDYz","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sanadis/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTc3NzgyNzc="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-02-26T22:06:30Z","title":"PDF/A PDF/UA Support","body":"Trying to figure out if either PDF/A or PDF/UA are supported.

However the fix doesn't fix it correctly (imho). It becomes obvious by looking at the junit test which was added with the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            //this was fixed, previously true\r\n            Assertions.assertFalse(fields.signatureCoversWholeDocument(signName));\r\n            PdfPKCS7 pdfPkcs7 = fields.verifySignature(signName, \"BC\");\r\n            //this is wrong - openPDF should not report that the signature is valid\r\n            Assertions.assertTrue(pdfPkcs7.verify());\r\n```\r\nIf you open the `siwa.pdf` in adobe reader it correctly reports a broken/invalid signature and so should openPDF.\r\nThe fix basically now detects that the signature doesn't cover the full document - but this does apply to all (perfectly correct) PDFs which have more than 1 signature. Because if you add a 2nd (or 3rd, 4th ...) all the previous signatures do not cover the whole document anymore. Only the last one potentially does. Now one could conclude that if there is only one signature (or the last one) and it doesn't cover the whole document, something is not right. However there are allowed changes to any signed document and if those changes have been applied in append mode then also the last (or only) signature does not cover the whole document.\r\n\r\nThus `pdfPkcs7.verify()` **must** return false to clearly state that something is not right with this document.\r\n\r\nWhat does the openPDF community think?","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487/labels{/name}","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","number":487,"updated_at":"2022-02-18T05:45:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF","id":801747033,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":6,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":null,"id":406365144,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDYzNjUxNDQ="},{"default":false,"color":"cc4916","name":"security","description":"","id":1262076072,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/labels/security","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjYyMDc2MDcy"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":1,"+1":1,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LibrePDF/OpenPDF/issues/487/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"Lonzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830174?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/Lonzak","site_admin":false,"id":1830174,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzAxNzQ=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lonzak/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MDE3NDcwMzM="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-01-28T01:02:01Z","title":"

mm to pt conversion due to floats","body":"Hi there!\r\n\r\nWe use OpenPDF to add bleed and trim boxes to PDF's exported with chrome/puppeteer. The size of the bleed and trim boxes are defined by a Rectangle which constructs out of 4 floats. We use mm to define the sizes, so we convert these to points first and that's when the problem occurs.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`126mm = 357.165354330708661417680 (using BigDecimal)`\r\n\r\nBut,

It does work in other readers, but I believe that is because they are more lenient than Acrobat on this issue, but unfortunately using another reader is not an option.\r\n\r\nI created a fork of OpenPDF and turned off font subsetting entirely and the output works fine, but obviously this is also not an real solution, because these fonts can be quite large and this particular font results in a minimum PDF size of 12MB, so the problem compounds when using multiple fonts.\r\n\r\nI inspected the PDF output with PDFBox's preflight and it errors with \"Font DICT invalid without \"Private\"
