To be honest, I haven't looked into it much aside from testing out the new feature.\r\n\r\nI also mention this here because the Aegis website talks about how GAuth doesn't support export, which isn't true as of today.

relevant but mentioning anyway) & Check I understand\r\nTap on OK\r\nVisit the \"Downloads\" folder containing the exported backup file\r\nShare the backup file via bluetooth with the device you want to transfer the vault to\r\nAfter successfully accepting the backup file, import it into Aegis on the handset it has been sent to\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThe vault is imported successfully.\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nThere is an error message on screen with a programming string and the vault is not imported.\r\n\r\nTo work around the error, I was able to export locally as JSON, then rename the file from .json to .txt so that Android will allow it to be sent via bluetooth, then transfer it to the other device, rename it back to .json from .txt

\"New User\" experience when moving between devices","body":"###### Info\r\n\r\n* __Version__: 2.02\r\n* __Source__: F-Droid\r\n* __Vault encrypted__: Yes, with biometric unlock\r\n* __Device__: Motorola One Vision\r\n* __Android version and ROM__: LineageOS 15\r\n\r\n###### Description\r\n\r\nThe user experience when moving from one device to another is extremely unintuitive. In order to complete the welcome wizard, you have to create a new database, which is fine for new users, but for users with an existing database (such as a user who upgraded to a new phone), you have to create a new database, then import all your old entries manually from a backup. If you wish to keep reusing the same password, you have to manually set the new database to use the same password as the backup one. It would be nice if this was a little easier and more streamlined. I was actually confused for a second on what to do because I was specifically looking for an \"import\" button in the welcome wizard. I am a power user so I figured it out pretty quickly, but a less experienced user might get very confused that they have to create a new database in order to use their existing one.\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use Aegis on your old phone\r\n2. Backup your aegis database on your old phone using the exporter\r\n3. Get a new phone (or simply delete aegis and it's data) and transfer the backup over to the new device\r\n4. Install aegis on the new phone\r\n5. In the Welcome to Aegis screen, press next\r\n6. Set a new password for a new vault (set the same password you're used to)\r\n7. Go to settings\r\n8. Import your old vault backup\r\n9. Type the password (even though it's the same as your new one) and press OK\r\n10. Import the vault contents\r\n11. You now have something resembling what you had before\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nRestoring a backup on a new device/install should be an easy, straightforward experience.\r\n\r\nI propose something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Use Aegis on your old phone\r\n2. Backup your aegis database on your old phone using the exporter\r\n3. Get a new phone (or simply delete aegis and it's data) and transfer the backup over to the new device\r\n4. Install aegis on the new phone\r\n5. After the first welcome screen (the one with the aegis logo), there's a new screen with 2 buttons, New Database or Restore From Backup\r\n6. press \"Restore from Backup\"\r\n7. Select the backup file\r\n8. The app will ask for your database password\r\n9. Type it and press OK\r\n10. Aegis is now ready to go in the same way it was when you used it on your other phone\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nIt's clunky as you need to make a new database (and use the same password manually if you want the same experience) and import the entries yourself in the settings menu.\r\n\r\n###### More Info\r\n\r\nThis will make for a much quicker/nicer experience when moving from an old phone to a new one.\r\n\r\nObviously this isn't really a \"bug\" in the strictest sense, it's more a usability issue. It should probably be considered low priority as a result.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In hindsight, I should have probably made this a feature request, not a bug report.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":897,"updated_at":"2022-08-17T17:24:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":1164755662,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":3,"closed_at":"2022-08-17T17:24:55Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":15,"+1":15,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/897/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"tunbridgep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31608726?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/tunbridgep","site_admin":false,"id":31608726,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjA4NzI2","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tunbridgep/orgs"},"node_id":"I_kwDOA-tiQc5FbMLO"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2022-03-10T02:02:04Z","title":"Ability to quickly copy other attributes (Name, Issuer, Note)","body":"I would find it useful to be able to copy other attributes when the need arises.\r\n\r\nOld version had a menu on long-press which would have been a nice place to have options like:\r\n\r\nCopy OTP\r\nCopy Name\r\nCopy Issuer\r\nCopy Note\r\nCopy Secret\r\n\r\nWithout this menu, perhaps there could be copy options show up on a swipe or double-tap or something?

pack but it doesn't know the websites I'm using.\r\nMaybe look at the KeePass add-ons which can pull the icon from a webpage.\r\n\r\nThe easiest must be just to let me pick a colour for the auto-generated icon with the first letter in it.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/885/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":885,"updated_at":"2022-02-13T12:10:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/885/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":1134749075,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/885/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":1,"closed_at":"2022-02-13T12:10:18Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/885","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A

there any chance to consider maintaining the Windows version of 2-FA TOTP app, like WinAuth?","body":"A couple years ago, an excellent windows app [WinAuth](https://github.com/winauth/winauth) has been under an active development. However, the author has stopped development eventually. Now, several years has passed, and there is still no REALISTIC 2-FA TOTP app for Windows users with similar development. However, alike your Aegis app (which is the exceptionally top-notch totp app I've ever came across for android) the WinAuth lacked many features (search, auto-copy, QR-code drag & drop and many others), which I've forked, added those features and published [a new repository](https://github.com/ttodua/winauth).  I think, that there are quite large audience of Windows users, who need to have TOPT 2-FA app on pc (instead of having a constant dependency on mobile device). My fork and updates gain some bit attraction and it seems the most-developed & forked one from all the forks, as seen [here](https://github.com/winauth/winauth/network/members) and [here](https://techgaun.github.io/active-forks/#winauth/winauth).\r\n\r\nSo, what I wanted to say - I think it will be a quite good if you took over that GPL 3.0 project, and thus, having a supported & popular 2-FA app for Windows, might be useful for community, if you will have any will to do so, and I will happily redirect my repository & followers to yours.

Aegis`)\r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/846/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":846,"updated_at":"2021-11-07T17:49:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/846/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":1046490312,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/846/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":2,"closed_at":"2021-11-07T17:49:54Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/846","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A

Keystore key invalidated after device unlock on Pixel 4","body":"#### Info\r\n\r\n* __Version__: 2.0.2\r\n* __Source__: Google Play\r\n* __Vault encrypted__: Yes, with password and biometric unlock\r\n* __Device__: Pixel 4\r\n* __Android version and ROM__: Android 11 stock\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Unlock phone\r\n- Open Aegis with biometric (face) unlock\r\n\r\n#### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI do not get asked for my Aegis password\r\n\r\n#### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nAegis \"detects a change in biometric security\" and asks for my password again.\r\n\r\nThe Google Pixel 4 (and probably newer Pixels) will \"improve\" the face matching with each successful device unlock, and so Aegis detects that the biometric security \"changed\", even though it's still the same face that is saved.\r\n\r\nIdeally, being able to detect whether face unlock has been *removed entirely* and re-added would be a better alternative, but I don't think that's possible through whatever API Android exposes.\r\n\r\nAs a second proposal, an option to turn off this detection (with a warning of what it means, of course), would be nice to have, as I store my Aegis password on an air-gapped computer and it is inconvenient to not be able to access my 2fa tokens when not at home.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/824/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":824,"updated_at":"2022-10-05T21:37:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/824/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":1004435672,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/824/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":9,"closed_at":"2022-10-05T11:57:08Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/824","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A

Biometric Security","body":"I've used some other apps where, the first time you run the app after restarting the phone, you must login using your password, not just the fingerprint sensor.\r\n\r\nThis is important because in some jurisdictions you can be compelled to provide your fingerprint, but not a password.\r\n\r\nI understand that the security of a 2fa app is less important than that of a password - more often than not, the device itself is the security - but since this is security focused, I still think it's a good idea.\r\n\r\nI also feel personally uncomfortable with someone being able to use just my fingerprint to unlock the device. I'd like the ability to completely disable biometrics entirely if possible.\r\n\r\nI propose the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Upon starting the app for the first time after restarting, the first login requires the password\r\n2. When using the lock item in the menu, it will also require the password to log in.\r\n3. Add an option to completely disable biometrics\r\n\r\nAlso, unrelated, here's a question: if I've NEVER used biometrics for the app, and law enforcement uses the \"or login using Biometric security\" link, will they then be able to use my fingerprint to log in - a login method I never consented to? That seems like a pretty major security oversight.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm being overly paranoid

help out a noob","body":"Hi there 👋\r\n\r\nI may not be correctly grasping the concept of using a 2FA authenticator app...\r\n\r\nSpecific scenario:\r\n\r\n- Researched what to do about the T-Mobile breach. \r\n\r\n- Found a WaPo article which included the following: \r\n\r\n> Rethink two-factor authentication\r\nIf you\u2019re even mildly security-conscious, you might already have two-factor authentication enabled on some of your online accounts - and that\u2019s good thinking. Here\u2019s the rub, though: If you\u2019re concerned your data has been compromised as part of this breach, it might be time to rethink how you use 2FA.\r\n\r\n> Let\u2019s say an attacker manages to obtain your name, date of birth and Social Security number  - if they luck out and find your address and reused password in other data dumps, that might be enough to give them access to your T-Mobile account. If that happens, you could be vulnerable to what\u2019s called a SIM-swap attack, in which the hacker manages to switch control of your phone number to a phone they control. That\u2019s definitely bad, but what could make it worse is if the verification codes sent by services like Amazon, Twitter and many banks are delivered via text message. In that case, the keys to your online kingdom could be ferried straight to someone else.\r\n\r\n> One possible fix: Lee suggests using, whenever possible, authenticator apps from companies like Google and Microsoft that live directly on your phone. \u201cJust having the text or the email that goes to the device is not as secure as having that authenticator app,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always recommend to consumers that they use that, and to businesses that they offer that.\"\r\n\r\n- Searched for \"open source 2FA app\", installed & set up Aegis and now have the opportunity to use it while signing up to make a credit freeze with Equifax.\r\n\r\n- Here's the reason for this help thread: on the page where it's asking to send a verification code, it only gives the options to select phone or email. And in the Aegis app, my option appears to be clicking the red plus, then either scanning a qr code, scanning an image or manually setting up an entry with info I'm not familiar with and don't believe is provided by the issuing website's verification page.\r\n\r\n- Is this a scenario where using such an authentication app (Aegis, Google, MS, etc) _only_ works if the issuing website in question actually lists a specified option to 'use Aegis Authenticator app\", or \"use Google Authenticator app\", etc?\r\n\r\nI must be missing something obvious.\r\nI checked the faqs but didn't find the answer. \r\n\r\nAny feedback would be appreciated!

The counter value is normally represented as a 64-bit big-endian integer when passed into HMAC-SHA1. Authy instead *directly uses the counter value as a base-10 ASCII string*. For example, the counter 12345678 would not be represented as `\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xBC\\x61\\x4E`, but as the bytes `12345678`.\r\n 2. The OTP secret is normally decoded from its base32 representation when it's used as the HMAC-SHA1 key. Authy decodes the base32-encoded secret *and then re-encodes it as lowercase ASCII hex*. For example, the secret `AEBAGBAFAYDQQ` would not be decoded into `\\x01\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x07\\x08`, but instead the ASCII string `0102030405060708` would be used.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish these codes from \"normal\" TOTP codes, I propose using a new URI type:\r\n\r\n```\r\notpauth://authy/...\r\n          ^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can test out the algorithm yourself with this self-contained Python script that generate pairs of RFC 4226 and \"Authy\" codes from a given secret: https://github.com/puddly/android-otp-extractor/issues/34#issuecomment-634447781\r\n\r\nThis is probably an unnecessary change as long as the Authy desktop app is still using RFC 4226 but if that changes in the future, you may find this info useful.\r\n\r\nThank you for the awesome app!","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":776,"updated_at":"2022-08-06T09:45:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":920980136,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":4,"closed_at":"2021-06-23T10:39:58Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/776/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"puddly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32534428?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/puddly","site_admin":false,"id":32534428,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTM0NDI4","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/puddly/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MjA5ODAxMzY="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-06-13T20:25:55Z","title":"add shortcut for applying group filter","body":"This adds a shortcut for applying a given group filter. Clicking on the shortcut opens the app and applies the group filter that was saved. This is useful for rapidly viewing entries for a specific group.\r\n\r\nCurrently the app only generates a shortcut for the current group filter. The way Android handles shortcuts is that the intent gets saved with the shortcut, so even if the group filter within the app is changed/removed, the group filter for the shortcut stays the same. If you want to create one shortcut for group \"foo\" and another for group \"bar\", you'd set the group filter to \"foo\", go to home screen, drag the shortcut \"Open group foo\" to home screen, open the app, change the group filter to \"bar\", go to home screen, and drag the shortcut for \"Open group bar\" to homescreen. At this point tapping on the \"foo\" icon would open the app with the \"foo\" filter applied, and tapping on the \"bar\" icon would open the app with the \"bar\" filter applied.

GitHub, for example, has a full security log:\r\n\r\n![securitylog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37388405/120898649-4e006f00-c61b-11eb-8deb-8ad70299871c.png)\r\n\r\nBut I won't remember the last time I logged into a website for long, especially if it's a website I seldom log into. I'd like to propose using Aegis as a reminder.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method I can think of is remembering only one timestamp and replacing it manually with the current time and date, like in this (crude) mockup:\r\n![mockup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37388405/120899130-aafd2480-c61d-11eb-8b85-9a48e2fa257d.png)\r\n\r\nWith this method, just after you log into an account, you would tap into your authenticator code (if you hadn't already), then check your last session date and time, and if they match, just tap the blue button to record this session's date and time. Repeat for every login. If your timestamp doesn't match the website's last timestamp, your account has been probably not-very-stealthily hijacked.\r\n\r\nThere are some problems with this method (the user has to be aware of timezone problems, it only detects a very specific kind of attack) and it's much less convenient on websites that don't show you your last session, but on those that do (like `europa.eu`) it could help detect these attacks with very little effort.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/765/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":765,"updated_at":"2021-08-25T13:47:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/765/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":912349764,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/765/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":3,"closed_at":"2021-08-25T13:47:10Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/765","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A

-->\r\n\r\n###### Info\r\n\r\n* __Version__: 2.0\r\n* __Source__: F-Droid\r\n* __Vault encrypted__: Yes (with biometric unlock)\r\n* __Device__: Samsung Galaxy S21\r\n* __Android version and ROM__:

Create a token, and modify the issuer name to include a suffix. For example, I might create a token with the issuer name `Nintendo Japan`.\r\n2. Import an icon pack with a matching issuer. For example, aegis-icons includes a Nintendo icon listed in `pack.json` with this info.\r\n```\r\n        {\r\n            \"filename\": \"SVG/Nintendo.svg\",\r\n            \"category\": \"1. Apps & Sites\",\r\n            \"issuer\": [\r\n                \"Nintendo\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Edit the token icon.\r\n4. Nothing appears under \"Suggested\", so type \"Nintendo\" in the search bar and select the icon that appears.\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nAegis should suggest the Nintendo icon when the token issuer name contains the pack issuer name.\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nAegis does not suggest the Nintendo icon when the token issuer name contains the pack issuer name. But it does in fact suggest the opposite - if I change token issuer to `Ninten`, then Aegis does suggest the appropriate icon.\r\n\r\n###### Log\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":761,"updated_at":"2021-06-23T10:33:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":910064008,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":4,"closed_at":"2021-06-23T10:33:08Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":"A bug report","id":425235723,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjUyMzU3MjM="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/761/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"ukanuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59303202?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/ukanuk","site_admin":false,"id":59303202,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAzMjAy","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ukanuk/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MTAwNjQwMDg="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-06-02T16:07:19Z","title":"Add usage count to entries","body":"This PR includes the ability to keep track of the usage count of each individual entry.

screen biometric unlock","body":"- Version: 1.4.2\r\n- Source: Google Play\r\n- Vault encrypted: Yes (with biometric unlock)\r\n- Device: Xiaomi A2 Lite\r\n- Android version and ROM: Android One 10 \r\n\r\nHi, I am a big fan of the Aegis 2FA app and use it a lot for all my 2FA. Therefore, I open the app quite regular on my phone and have one proposal:\r\nWhen you open the app the keyboard is automatically activated and preventing me to click the \u2018biometric\u2019 unlock link. Steps I take after opening the apps are: \r\n\r\n1.\tRemove keyboard (move down)\r\n2.\tClick biometric link\r\n3.\tUse biometric fingerprint unlock\r\n\r\nProposal: If biometric unlock is activated don\u2019t show the keyboard but directly show the \u2018decrypt the fault with biometric screen\u2019, ready to accept you fingerprint.

Tapping the \"biometrics\" text to switch to biometric unlocking wouldn't be a huge issue but I use a password manager and the password field is being parsed causing my password manager to throw extra text on the screen. The \"biometrics\" text, which I have to tap, ends up being a small target I have to accurately press every time I need to unlock Aegis.\r\n![aegis-unlock-small-button-smaller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12111013/103494606-911da280-4e2f-11eb-82a9-d323312e338b.png)\r\n\r\nWhilst there may be an option in my password manager's app to disable this sort of thing for this specific app, I think it would be cleaner if either there was a setting to default to biometric unlocking (or even tie this functionality to the setting which enables biometric unlocking in the first place), or if the app remembered the last used unlocking method and presented that method to the user (I prefer doing it this way).\r\n\r\nThanks for everything so far, I look forward to using Aegis for the foreseeable future

So i though i would write this guide to help others!\r\n\r\nFirst off you need to open your SDA (Steam Desktop Authenticator) file directory, and find the *.maFile inside maFiles folder (Open it with notepad) . In there you will see all the data you need like shared_secret and more. \r\n\r\nThen create a new file name Steamguard-myConfig.json on your desktop(It has to be in json format), and copy-paste all the contents of the maFile into the new json file. \r\n\r\nThen connect your android phone to your pc and open the file directory and copy the file into the Downloads folder (Or any other you have access to on the phone). \r\n\r\nAfter doing that you need to open Aegis and go into settings and scroll all the way down and click on import from file. Choose Steam as the option and click Ok. Then select the newly imported Steamguard-myConfig.json file. \r\n\r\nYou should now have your steam code inside Aegis as well!\r\n\r\nHope my guide helped someone!

So I don't think I'm doing something wrong. \r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nSuccessfully import accounts from other Authentication apps and successfully adding new accounts into Aegis. \r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\n\"Verification code is invalid\" error every time I try to login or add new accounts. \r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":613,"updated_at":"2020-11-27T23:56:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":746540467,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":2,"closed_at":"2020-11-27T23:56:35Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":"A bug report","id":425235723,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjUyMzU3MjM="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/613/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"rafamadriz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67771985?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/rafamadriz","site_admin":false,"id":67771985,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzcxOTg1","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafamadriz/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NDY1NDA0Njc="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-11-17T22:08:27Z","title":"I can't import Steam over WinAuth","body":"I 've been using Aeagis for a while now, and so far I'm satisfied. \r\n\r\nHowever, I still have one problem, and that is Steam. \r\n\r\nI still have Steam on WinAuth.

Lots of users have been using [krisu5's icon\r\npack](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons) as a source for icons in Aegis. The icon pack is great, but it's a bit of a pain for users to use, and that's Aegis' fault. To make the experience better, we want to introduce support for icon packs.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that creators of icon packs format their releases in the standard way described in this proposal, so that Aegis can read and use them. \r\n\r\nThis way, we can keep the maintenance of icons packs and Aegis itself separate, while also offering users the ability to use/create icon packs without being forced to use the one provided by the app.\r\n\r\n@krisu5 We'd appreciate your feedback on this.\r\n\r\n### The format\r\n\r\nIcon packs are .ZIP archives with a collection of icons and a ``pack.json`` file. The icon pack definition is a JSON file, formatted like the example below. All icon packs have a name, a UUID, a version and a list of icons. The version number is incremented when a new version of the icon pack is released. The UUID is randomly generated once and stays the same across different versions.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"uuid\": \"e77dbfb5-30d6-468d-bf74-37f07734bcf5\",\r\n    \"name\": \"Kristian's Icon Pack\",\r\n    \"version\": 1,\r\n    \"icons\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"filename\": \"services/Google.png\",\r\n            \"category\": \"Services\",\r\n            \"issuer\": [ \"google\" ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"filename\": \"services/Blizzard.png\",\r\n            \"category\": \"Gaming\",\r\n            \"issuer\": [ \"blizzard\", \"battle.net\" ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery icon definition contains the filename of the icon file, relative to the root of the .ZIP archive. Icon definitions also have a list of strings that the Issuer field in Aegis is matched against for automatic selection of an icon for new entries. Matching is done in a case-insensitve manner. There's also a category field.\r\n\r\nThe following image formats are supported, in order of preference:\r\n\r\n| Name | MIME          | Extension |\r\n|:-----|:--------------|:----------|\r\n| SVG  | image/svg+xml | .svg      |\r\n| PNG  | image/png     | .png      |\r\n| JPEG | image/jpeg    | .jpg      |\r\n\r\nAny files in the .ZIP archive that are not the ``pack.json`` file or referred to in the icons list are ignored. Such files are not extracted when importing the icon pack into Aegis.\r\n\r\n### Changes to Aegis' vault format\r\n\r\nSupporting multiple image formats also means that we have to make a small change to Aegis' vault format. Aegis currently only stores and expects JPEG images. We'd have to introduce a new ``icon_mime`` field for entries to store the MIME type of the icon. When loading older vaults, entries that do not have that field will try to parse the icon as JPEG.\r\n\r\nI previously proposed moving icons out of the vault file entirely in #134, but that would be a much larger change, and has stalled improvements to our icon support. We can revisit if that's still desirable later.\r\n\r\nWe may also have to increment the vault format version, because previous versions of Aegis will no longer be able to load vaults with these changes.\r\n\r\n### Using icon packs in Aegis\r\n\r\nUsers can download an icon pack from the internet and import it into Aegis through the settings menu. Aegis extracts the icon pack to ``icons/{uuid}/{version}``, relative to its internal storage directory. So for the example icon pack above, that'd be:\r\n``icons/e77dbfb5-30d6-468d-bf74-37f07734bcf5/1.0``. If it has an old version of the icon pack, it will be removed after successful extraction of the newer version. \r\n\r\nAfter that, Aegis will start proposing icons for new entries if the issuer matches with one of the icons in the pack. We'll also have an icon selection dialog, where all of the icons in the pack appear. When the user selects an icon, it is copied and stored in the vault file.\r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/509/labels{/name}","author_association":"MEMBER","number":509,"updated_at":"2021-06-12T16:55:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/509/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":651101670,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/509/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":39,"closed_at":"2021-04-10T08:50:36Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/509","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"4393e8","name":"proposal-accepted","description":"An

discoverability of drag-and-drop feature","body":"Hi there! I have been using Aegis for a while and love the features it provides.\r\n\r\nAegis currently supports a drag and drop feature for reordering items with the following procedure:\r\n1. Long press an item, then release\r\n2. Long press the item again and hold\r\n3. Drag the item to the desired location\r\n\r\nThis is unintuitive and hard for users to discover. It seems I'm not the only one too: #482 #322 #357\r\n\r\nIn most other apps, drag and drop can be done by simply long-pressing the item and dragging. There is no need to release before selecting the item again. Alternatively, many apps add a drag handle which the user can use to move items around. It would be great if you could implement something similar to improve usability.\r\n\r\nBased on what I've seen of your code, you should be able to implement this using the [startDrag function in ItemTouchHelper](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/ItemTouchHelper#startDrag(androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder)). If you want, I can try my hand at implementing this myself (though it may take a while as I'm not familiar with your codebase).\r\n\r\nI hope you'll take my suggestion into account.

Long-press Drag and Drop reordering","body":"Hello there!\r\nFirst of all, great work with Aegis, love the app so far after switching from the long-outdated RedHat FreeOTP.\r\nI have stumbled over on minor OCD triggering issue though and would like to open this feature request/proposal to fix it or at least discuss this.\r\n\r\nMy \"issue\" is related to the entry ordering and the inability to reorder entries manually. Other OTP applications, be that the Google Authenticator or the ancient FreeOTP I am migrating from, allow their users to drag and drop the entries manually, yet this seems not to work in Aegis.\r\nAs far as I can tell the \"Custom\" ordering in Aegis only orders the entries according to the times they got added, yet does not allow the manipulation of that order.\r\nI sadly realized this a bit too late and messed up my \"Custom\" ordering of my entries by not following my original order from FreeOTP, but by which service I could migrate easies.\r\n\r\nI know my issue isn't a high priority issue in any way; maybe it is even just me who would love to reorder his entries in the \"Custom\" order manually. Still, I wanted to open this request/discussion.\r\n\r\nI hope I could present my request and its origin at least somewhat concisely, but should I have missed something obvious or should there be any more context needed, feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and maybe considering this, but definitely keep up the great work!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am sorry should I have missed an already existing issue regarding this request, but my search in the open and closed issues didn't yield anything similar.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":482,"updated_at":"2020-11-01T01:48:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":642439718,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":9,"closed_at":"2020-06-21T00:31:54Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/482/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"h1dden-da3m0n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33120068?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/h1dden-da3m0n","site_admin":false,"id":33120068,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTIwMDY4","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h1dden-da3m0n/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDI0Mzk3MTg="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-06-19T17:45:49Z","title":"Unset \"singleTask\" as the launchMode for MainActivity","body":"We don't actually need this, and I have a feeling that it may be causing some of\r\nthe inexplicable crashes we're seeing in the Play Console.

Sometimes users are confused because they don't realize the \"Password\" and \"Biometrics\" button is behind that reminder. This led to user thinking the ability to use biometrics doesn't exists even though they have set it up in the app.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nI can work on these features, but I want to know what people

I noticed Steam in the dropdown menu of the app; & proceeded with submitting a Google Play review, to confirm that its referring to Steam. I followed instructions on how to obtain a \"shared_secret\". After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that \"shared_secret\" is the secret needed for the new profile.\r\n\r\nI selected the Steam dropdown from the list of types (Right after TOTP & HOTP, the third being Steam). I successfully obtained my shared_secret, & attempted to add the profile. Lastly, I select \"save\" to finish the profile. From there, I get the error: \"Add new profile\" it returns: \"Secret is not valid base32\". I consulted the creator of the github repo that I used to obtain the \"shared_secret\" from (this case being \"Steam Desktop Authenticator\"). His response was that shared_secret isn't the field I should be looking for, and that the app needs to add specific support for using one of those. I concluded that the best course of action was to make a GitHub Issue thread, as this seems to be more of an issue with Aegis app itself, rather than Steam.\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI expected the app to successfully add the profile to my Aegis list of 2FA services.\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nReturned \"Error saving profile\": \"Secret is not valid base32\".\r\n\r\n###### Log\r\n\r\n```\r\nError saving profile:\r\nSecret is not valid base32.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would add a screenshot, but the app has a secure flag, that prohibits taking screenshots while this app is in the foreground.\r\n","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":390,"updated_at":"2020-07-04T11:56:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":611306328,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":6,"closed_at":"2020-07-04T11:56:44Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":"A bug report","id":425235723,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjUyMzU3MjM="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/390/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"Chaprnks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6340970?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaprnks","site_admin":false,"id":6340970,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDA5NzA=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaprnks/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MTEzMDYzMjg="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-05-02T19:31:55Z","title":"Write entries to the vault directly in EditEntryActivity","body":"This makes it so that EditEntryActivity directly saves entries to the vault, instead of passing them back to MainActivity through an Intent first.

Open QR Code scanner and scan any 2FA QR Code. The options menu pops up after successfully scanning it (the one with Account, issuer, SHA-1, etc)\r\n2. Click on icon (the first letter of issuer by default I guess ) and then proceed to insert user icon. from local storage.\r\n3.

Only one entry must be produced/made.\r\n\r\nWhat happens instead?\r\n1. 2 entries are made\r\n\r\nThe 2 entries are made irrespective of whether you actually select a icon from local storage. That is, even if you go back without selecting an icon, and use default icon, 2 entries are made. If you use a icon from your storage, it makes 2 entries. (I use the icon pack mentioned at the bottom of your README.md). 2 entries are NOT made, when selecting icon by editing the entry, after it has been made.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: Also, the app completely crashes multiple times when you attempt to delete the 2nd entry, after deleting the 1st entry produced by the above means(manual image selection one).** \r\n\r\n(Don't know if crash is only for deleting entries produced in above mentioned way, or app crashes whenever you delete 2 entries one after the other.

Image Editing Tweak: Save current view/crop when pressing save button for entry","body":"First just want to say thank you for all of your hard work, this really is a great app! Just came across it today, and am loving it!\r\n\r\nI had a thought about a small UX request, as currently when editing the picture for an entry, the user flow is to:\r\n- Tap the current icon\r\n- find an icon image in their gallery app of choice\r\n- select that image\r\n- Select the checkmark icon at the bottom right of the dark-gray crop overlay screen\r\n- Press save at the top right\r\n\r\nEspecially when cropping an image after selecting, this process seems somewhat self-evident. However in a case were adding premade/pre-sized/pre-cropped icons (ie from the community icon pack), the crop overlay aligns perfectly with the background, making it easier to miss that the image is in \"edit\" mode. If one does miss this, and select the Save button at the top, the image will not be saved, and the user will have to start the process over again.\r\n\r\nWould it then be possible to modify the image selection behavior with one (or a combination) of tweaks for better usability:\r\n - A text tooltip indicating \"Crop/Edit\" mode is active\r\n - Save currently shown crop/edit of image when \"Save\" is selected\r\n - Launch a dialogue asking the user to save/discard the unsaved changes (or cancel the action of saving) \r\n\r\nThese are just some ideas about small tweaks, but feel free to suggest others or modify them as needed. Just seems like an area where the app could improve with potentially few changes.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":345,"updated_at":"2020-04-07T09:36:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":595434430,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":3,"closed_at":"2020-04-07T09:36:16Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":1,"+1":1,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/345/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"AyoungDukie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5449443?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/AyoungDukie","site_admin":false,"id":5449443,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDk0NDM=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AyoungDukie/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTU0MzQ0MzA="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2020-04-03T22:45:52Z","title":"Add selection indicator to ListItem","body":"Attempt to add an indicator to selected items like mentioned in #335.\r\n\r\nProblems while implementing:\r\n\r\n1.

I was wondering, if I can have the 2FA run on a non-phone device like a website or a javabox or something else that I could take my personal backup and then run it from there. It would provide also near feature parity with Authy in that regards as it can run in a Chrome App or install on windows or macosx. (Yes I'd be running my own backend backups but that would really help. Even if it didn't allow for editing the data but at least reading and running the 2FA codes.)","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/289/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":289,"updated_at":"2020-01-29T19:17:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/289/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":550259643,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/289/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":1,"closed_at":"2020-01-29T19:17:18Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/289","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A

Info\r\n\r\n* __Version__: 1.0.2\r\n* __Source__: G-Droid (F-Droid)\r\n* __Vault encrypted:__ Yes (with fingerprint unlock)\r\n* __Android version and ROM:__ 8.0.0, stock Moto Z Play\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nFollow setup process with fingerprint unlock\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nSetup to complete and go into main app\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nSetup said it was complete and app was ready, but tapping checkmark button to leave setup and go to app did nothing, then opening recent apps and reselecting Aegis (was going to try closing and reopening, but for whatever reason switched right back to it first) starts setup all over, requiring reentry of password and fingerprint.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of is that I started it last night and left it at the password entry screen in setup, then came back to it this afternoon (~12 hours later) and finished after having switched to and opened other apps. So perhaps the long delay and/or switching to other apps then back caused the issue. Since it's only during setup, it's not a huge deal, but it did mean I had to type my long password an extra couple times. I tried testing this on my Galaxy Tab S2, but even though the fingerprint sensor registered initially, after I switched around to other apps and did other stuff for a while, when I switched back to Aegis it wouldn't register anymore.\r\n\r\n###### Log\r\n\r\nNone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":227,"updated_at":"2020-08-01T12:11:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":502777630,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":0,"closed_at":"2020-08-01T12:11:36Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":"A bug report","id":425235723,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjUyMzU3MjM="}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/227/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"vertigo220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12024557?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/vertigo220","site_admin":false,"id":12024557,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI0NTU3","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDI3Nzc2MzA="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2019-10-02T15:14:03Z","title":"Google Play Store - Unable to install on Pixelbook or Dell Chromebook 11","body":"Please update Google Play Store options to allow installation on Chromebooks.

__Version__: 1.0.1\r\n* __Source__: Google Play\r\n* __Vault encrypted:__ Yes (no fingerprint unlock)\r\n* __Android version and ROM:__ 7.0\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1) unlock the vault\r\n2) push home button (not back button)\r\n3) launch Aegis again\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nIt should auto-lock (it used to work perfectly with previous version

UUIDMap for storing objects that are keyed by a UUID","body":"This patch introduces the ``UUIDMap`` type, with the goal of reducing code duplication and improving UUID lookups. We currently already use UUIDs as the identifier for the ``DatabaseEntry`` and ``Slot`` types, but the way lookups by UUID work are kind of ugly, as we simply iterate over the list until we find a match. As we're probably going to have more types like this soon (groups and icons, for example), I figured it'd be good to abstract this away into a separate type and make it a map instead of a list.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that has gotten slower is the ``swap`` method. The internal ``LinkedHashMap`` retains insertion order with a linked list, but does not know about the position of the values, so we basically have to copy the entire map to simply swap two values. I don't think it's too big of a deal, because swap -operations still take much less than a millisecond even with large vaults, but suggestions for improving this are welcome.\r\n\r\nI had to update gradle and JUnit to be able to use the new ``assertThrows`` assertion method in tests, so this patch includes that as well.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/136/labels{/name}","author_association":"MEMBER","number":136,"updated_at":"2019-08-04T17:41:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"draft":false,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/136/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":454355257,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/136/timeline","pull_request":{"patch_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/pull/136.patch","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/pull/136","merged_at":"2019-08-04T17:41:27Z","diff_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/pull/136.diff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/pulls/136"},"state_reason":null,"comments":3,"closed_at":"2019-08-04T17:41:28Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/136","labels":[],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/136/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/pull/136","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/136/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"alexbakker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2387841?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbakker","site_admin":false,"id":2387841,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODc4NDE=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/orgs"},"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg2ODIzMDYz"},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2019-06-09T20:41:05Z","title":"Move entry divider logic to EntryListView","body":"This patch makes EntryListView responsible for providing the divider between entries, instead of setting a margin on every entry like we do now.

This decision was made early on in the project to get quick and easy support for icons, but as more people are starting to use Aegis, this technical debt is starting to show issues all over. It's a source of performance issues and crashes. The most recent example of this is #130.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose to move icons out of the vault file, into a separate folder. This would allow us to load the vault separately from the icons, improving performance and stability, with the cost of some added complexity to the code. All icons would be stored in the ``icons`` folder, with random UUID's as filenames. I think we should still encrypt them, so entries in the vault also need a reference to their icon, along with some parameters for decryption. It'd look like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"icon\": {\r\n\t\"uuid\": \"01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef\",\r\n\t\"mime\": \"image/jpeg\",\r\n\t\"params\": {\r\n\t\t\"nonce\": \"0123456789abcdef01234567\",\r\n\t\t\"tag\": \"0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs icons are no longer included in the vault, they would also not be included in exports. We'd have to use some kind of container format to export the vault along with all of the icons, like ``zip`` or ``tar``. Java seems to have a decent API to create zip files, so we might as well use that, but I'd rather have something that doesn't do compression as we won't benefit much from that anyway.\r\n\r\nThe only security-related consequence is that someone with access to the vault would be able to determine the (minimum) amount of entries the vault contains. I think that's acceptable.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134/labels{/name}","author_association":"MEMBER","number":134,"updated_at":"2020-07-22T15:41:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":453382012,"state":"closed","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134/timeline","state_reason":"completed","comments":2,"closed_at":"2020-07-22T15:41:27Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":4,"+1":0,"rocket":4,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/134/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"alexbakker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2387841?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbakker","site_admin":false,"id":2387841,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODc4NDE=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/orgs"},"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"alexbakker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2387841?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbakker","site_admin":false,"id":2387841,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODc4NDE=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbakker/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTMzODIwMTI="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2019-06-06T18:34:11Z","title":"Notification if database is unlocked","body":"When a PIN is set for Signal and I have unlocked it, there's a persistent notification at the top which lets me know that Signal is unlocked and gives me the option to lock it or enter the app (that notification goes away if I lock it).

Open the app (and unlock the vault when encrypted)\r\n1. Make sure all your filters are default and you have enough tokens saved so you can scroll\r\n2. Scroll down so the FAB hides\r\n3.

Luckily (I thought), PBKDF2 produces collisions for inputs with trailing null bytes and thus scrypt does this as well, so we could safely change that function to remove the null bytes without any impact. Unfortunately, that doesn't hold up if the password is over 64 bytes in size. So after that change, the KDF started producing different keys than before for such passwords and thus some users could no longer unlock their vault.\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses the issue by using the

-->\r\n\r\n###### Info\r\n\r\n-  __Version__: 2.0.3\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSet _'tap to reveal'_ in app settings. Managed to get it look like that on Samsung with default system font.\r\n\r\n###### What do you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nThe feature was made to look like this: https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/pull/486. Unfortunately it turns out this solution isn't flexible enough to always display the bullet points like shown in the mentioned PR. For me it looks really bad and I expect Aegis to either have a custom font for codes and placeholders, or change the way placeholders are displayed when turned _'tap to reveal'_ on. I suggest to make them consistent and make both the displayed code and hidden asterisks' font look similar and suit the overall app design.\r\n\r\n###### What happens instead?\r\n\r\nBullet placeholders shown below are way too big and totally unproportional compared to the code size on some devices.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110673332/199312663-31562df4-f99f-4bc3-8c8f-e5c9ef383ed1.png)","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/1012/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":1012,"updated_at":"2022-11-01T19:16:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/1012/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":1431950013,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/1012/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":0,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/1012","labels":[{"default":true,"color":"ee0701","name":"bug","description":"A

with the new code.\r\n\r\nI know that Aegis has an option to freeze a token when it is tapped, but that's just adding unnecessary work for the user.\r\nThe right solution would be to make sure the user can always see a token that will stay visible for at least half the TOTP time slot.\r\n\r\nThe andOTP app implements a simple solution for this: After a token expired, it is still shown on the side (in smaller letters), so that the user can complete their login.\r\n\r\nThe de-luxe solution would be a sliding window that always shows two tokens:\r\n- **Token1** | Token2 `// start: future token is shown on the right`\r\n- Token1 | **Token2** `// T1 expired`\r\n- ..en1 | **Token2** `// after 1/3 of the time slot, T1 slides away to the left to make space for an eventual T3`\r\n- **Token2** | Token3 `// last 1/3 of the time slot: new T3 appears`\r\n- Token2 | **Token3** `// T2 expired`\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nInstead of bold/regular, better use colored/gray text so that the width

This is due to two factors: Each entry is edited one at a time, and the UX for switching icons is not optimized for doing this efficiently (options are in deeply nested menus and require multiple taps from the user).\r\n\r\nAny batch operation will be imperfect because user preferences for icons are nondeterministic. Worst case, this allows the user to assign a majority of icons to entries so that they only need to go back and edit/customize a few entries they are unhappy with. This still saves significant time and improves the usability of the app icons feature.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\nThe below acceptance criteria is subject to change by the development team as necessary and reasonable. The initial goal of this list is to give this feature request some substance.\r\n\r\n- Aegis makes a reasonable attempt to assign a default icon to each 2FA entry where reasonable. Examples:\r\n  - Only one icon exists for a service: Choose that one\r\n  - Multiple icons exist for a single service: Choose an application-defined default, such as the first icon in the list. The specific choice algorithm here is irrelevant; only the outcome is important.\r\n- Batch icon assignment is not automatic. Not every user may want to do this, especially those with only a handful of 2FA entries. A conveniently accessible manual option will be provided to the user to batch assign a specific icon pack. Specific UX design is left open to the developer of this user story.\r\n- Appropriate documentation is written instructing users how to use this new feature, including but not limited to:\r\n  - Specific icon-choosing behaviors, such as when icons cannot be chosen automatically and under what conditions this can occur.\r\n  - Explanation and disclaimer stating that automatic icon assignment is imperfect by design. Instruct the users that they can still manually edit icons after batch assignment if they are unhappy with specific icon choices.\r\n\r\n### References, Links\r\n\r\n- Related to #509 (Icon Packs)","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":773,"updated_at":"2022-11-06T16:51:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":919610659,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":3,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"4393e8","name":"proposal-accepted","description":"An accepted proposal for a new feature","id":425235727,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal-accepted","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MjUyMzU3Mjc="},{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":14,"+1":12,"rocket":1,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/773/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":1},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"rcdailey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1768054?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/rcdailey","site_admin":false,"id":1768054,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjgwNTQ=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rcdailey/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MTk2MTA2NTk="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-06-03T13:39:30Z","title":"Screen rotation cancels group selection","body":"<!-- Please read the [bug reports section of the contribution\r\nguidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports) before submitting an issue. -->\r\n\r\n###### Info\r\n\r\n* __Version__: 2.0\r\n* __Source__: Google Play\r\n* __Vault encrypted__: Yes (with biometric unlock)\r\n* __Device__: Pixel 5\r\n* __Android version and ROM__: 11\r\n\r\n###### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nA detailed list of reproduction steps.\r\n\r\n1.

While you are at it, implement KDF caching using Argon2's \"server relief\" to drastically increase the cost of brute-forcing the vault backups.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nKey Derivation Functions attempt to squeeze additional security out of low-quality secrets by increasing the computational cost of a brute force attack.  The amount a key can be stretched is ultimately limited by usability requirements.  The industry standard practice of hardcoding of specific values technically violate [NIST's KDF guidelines](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf):\r\n\r\n> The iteration count shall be selected as large as possible, as long as the time required to generate the key using the entered password is acceptable for the users.\r\n\r\nIndustry hasn't done much about this because increasing KDF values would represent a major expense for service providers and a DoS attack vector.  Part of the rethink done for the password hashing competition was to formalize a technique in which clients would perform the majority of the work for server.  Argon2 calls this \"server relief\" and is provides an error-resistant API.\r\n\r\nWhile Aegis doesn't have a client/server model, abusing  caching can be used to increase the cost for offline attackers while maintaining a good user experience.  The simplest example/implementation of KDF caching would be to set a very high KDF iteration value for the backup vault and cache an intermediate value within the apps' private storage area.  The user would only experience a high KDF wait time during the initial setup and when restoring from a backup.  This wouldn't do much against a root exploit, but it can increase the cost of other attacks by 10-100x.\r\n\r\nThe following KDF run times roughly align with [user perception/delay tolerance](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/):\r\n\r\n1. **100ms - 200ms** app closed\r\n2. **[1s - 5s](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/154193120204600511)** phone reboot\r\n3. **1m-10m** initial setup/sync or restoration from backup\r\n\r\nThe first tier provides marginal security gains to a narrow group of high-risk users, like protesters without enough op-sec experience to setup work mode.  The additional complexity is only justifiable if key material is already being flushed from memory to help mitigate side channel attacks.\r\n\r\nThe second tier delay should be masked using an animation that also communicates that the delay helps increase security.  The third tier cache isn't needed for on-device functionality and can be run as a background task.  Users can be expected to tolerate restoring from backups for much longer than normal, as long as you provide accurate feedback on how long the task will take.\r\n\r\nEdge cases in which restoring to a new device would take over an hour or when the new device just doesn't have enough memory can be handled by entering the private key by scanning a QR code or manually entering a mnemonic.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":697,"updated_at":"2021-03-25T00:23:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":819586426,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":8,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":2,"+1":2,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/697/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"indolering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44454?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/indolering","site_admin":false,"id":44454,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDU0","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/indolering/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTk1ODY0MjY="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-03-01T19:46:49Z","title":"Add options for larger text for tokens, and maybe colored text","body":"I really like Aegis, but I think the UI could be improved.\r\n\r\nConsider this: the UI looks very nice and clean when I'm just looking right at it on my phone, but that's often not how it works. Often, I'm looking at it on my desk, out of the corner of my eye, as I type a code for some login. Keep in mind that I have several different services for which I have MFA tokens, and at a glance it's very easy to confuse one for another. Also, I'm likely to be distracted at the time. Somebody tells me that some of our servers are having problems, so I have to quick log into AWS SSO while I'm trying to get more information from them about what's known about the problem at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis was a regular problem for me when I used Google Authenticator 5.0. I would type the code for my corporate LastPass when trying to log into our VPN, and vice versa. And of course, my LastPass password is naturally pretty long and complicated, so the idea that I mistyped in the first time isn't impossible, so I can make the same mistake over and over.\r\n\r\nRecently I ended up downloading and trying every single MFA app I could find on either the Play store or F-Droid. One of my favorites from a UI perspective was actually the [Epic Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epic.authenticator), in spite of its lack of a 3-digit break. The large numbers and automatically-different colors was exactly what I wanted. Now, the Epic app is unacceptable for other reasons, but I think it has some good ideas you could profitably steal.\r\n\r\nSo first of all, I would suggest adding more options for even larger text for the token numbers. I'm fine with only being able to fit 3 or 4 codes on the screen if the numbers are really big and easy to read out of the corner of my eye. Also, you currently stack the service name and the user name for the token above the code, whereas I think an option to put these underneath the icon would allow you to make large token text work better. \r\n\r\nSecond of all, an option to automatically choose a color for the token would aid tremendously in making it easy to locate the correct token when looking at the app from the corner of your eye. Ideally, this would be done in a predictable way, so that the same combination of service name and user name always resulted in the same color. Like you could hash \"Github\" and \"dradetsky\" into an rgb code, or something along those lines. Maybe there's some subset of the full rgb spectrum well known to frontend people to look good & readable on black & white backgrounds respectively. Or maybe you just choose a set of colors which are easy to distinguish from each other, and make the first code always be color0, the second code always be color1, etc.","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":696,"updated_at":"2021-08-22T08:52:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":819192336,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":1,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":0,"+1":0,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/696/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":0},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"dradetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/947430?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/dradetsky","site_admin":false,"id":947430,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NzQzMA==","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dradetsky/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MTkxOTIzMzY="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2021-02-27T04:49:37Z","title":"Mnemonic Phrase for Backups","body":"TL;DR: The best trade-off between security and usability for off-device backups is a setup workflow/wizard that instructs the user to write down or print off the encryption key.  This is what many online services do when activating 2FA and how most cryptocurrency wallets operate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTOTP apps, password managers, and crypto-currency wallets are all domain-specific secrets managers.  The security model is fundamentally identical, their value comes in isolating failure: Aegis on your phone hedges against a XSS attack against your password manager's browser extension.\r\n\r\nTOTP managers tie a device to an account, protected by the pin/pattern/biometrics of the phone.

Maybe it's just me, but coming from Authy, where you just scan a barcode (something I just learned isn't recommended) or manually enter the string provided by the service the 2FA is being set up for and then you're done, I'm having a tough time figuring out how to use this. In contrast to the very simple setup of Authy, Aegis requires much more info to be entered and choices to be made, and I have no idea what to put and choose. It would be ideal to have a guide, both in the app and here, on the different fields and what they mean and which options are generally preferred.\r\n\r\n* Name: I assume this would just be whatever label you want to assign, e.g. Email\r\n* Issuer: I assume this would be the site, e.g. Google, Firefox, etc, but it's unclear if it needs to be in any particular format or if it's even necessary. One site I found (https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format) says it's \"strongly recommended\" but I don't really follow the logic. AFAICT, as long as the labels are unique enough, this isn't needed, but I could be way off.\r\n* TOTP/HOTP/Steam: I know TOTP is the most common, and from what I can tell it's more secure, so I assume it's the recommended one to use unless HOTP is necessary for some reason. Steam is obvious, of course, though I suppose it's possible some users might not know what it is, so still wouldn't be a bad idea to give a quick explanation on it as well.\r\n* SHA1/SHA256/SHA512: I know SHA1 is bad/broken for encryption purposes, and 512 is better than 256, but a) not everyone will know this, b) from what I can tell SHA1 should be fine for OTP, at least TOTP, and c) it's not clear if you can use any of them for any service, or how it would affect the keys provided vs expected.*\r\n* Digits / Time: These ones are obvious, though, as with the hash, it's not clear if/how it would affect the keys.*\r\n* Secret: I assume this is the long string provided by the service in place of a barcode.\r\n\r\n*I don't have an in-depth understanding of how OTP codes are generated and work, obviously, and I always thought that each service has its own, specific way of doing it. So for example, I assumed that if you set up 2FA on Google/Facebook/whatever, the barcode or key would determine how it's calculated, so the generator and the website would always match. Based on that logic, if you change the hash, digit length, or timeout, they wouldn't match. I hesitated for a bit to set up a 2FA because of this, but having been a while since I've set one up, in doing so now I see it has you enter the code from the generator to complete setup, so I'm guessing it determines what various settings you used based on that?","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230/labels{/name}","author_association":"NONE","number":230,"updated_at":"2019-10-07T17:06:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230/comments","active_lock_reason":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis","id":502808218,"state":"open","locked":false,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230/timeline","state_reason":null,"comments":2,"closed_at":null,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230","labels":[{"default":false,"color":"84b6eb","name":"proposal","description":"A proposal for a new feature","id":1557492076,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/labels/proposal","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU3NDkyMDc2"}],"milestone":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230/events","html_url":"https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230","reactions":{"confused":0,"-1":0,"total_count":7,"+1":5,"rocket":0,"hooray":0,"eyes":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/230/reactions","laugh":0,"heart":2},"assignee":null,"user":{"gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/gists{/gist_id}","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/repos","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/following{/other_user}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"vertigo220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/followers","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/subscriptions","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/received_events","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12024557?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/events{/privacy}","html_url":"https://github.com/vertigo220","site_admin":false,"id":12024557,"gravatar_id":"","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI0NTU3","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertigo220/orgs"},"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDI4MDgyMTg="},{"assignees":[],"created_at":"2019-09-17T12:00:12Z","title":"Allow square/uncropped icons","body":"The current behavior displays all icons as circles.\r\n\r\nI wish I could use plain square/uncropped images as icons, as I already has a small collection of such images.
